This SQL course is our first step in that direction.\n\nThe course has been designed with a focus on practical learning. Each topic is accompanied by hands-on exercises, real-world examples, and an integrated coding environment where you can practice what you learn. The AI integration provides personalized learning assistance, helping you grasp concepts better and faster.\n\nCheck out the course at [roadmap.sh/courses/sql](https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql)\n";
