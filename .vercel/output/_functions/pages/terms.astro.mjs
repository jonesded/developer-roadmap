The only exception to the Arbitration Agreement is that either of us may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). You may reject this Arbitration Agreement by providing us with written notice of such rejection within 30 days of your first access to the Services or of the date a change to this Arbitration Agreement became effective. In order to be effective notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have or may enter in the future with us. <strong>YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR SIMILAR ACTION, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW. YOU AND THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.</strong> Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>) in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at <a href=\"http://www.adr.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. (<strong>“FAA”</strong>), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of New York. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. If the claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents we submit to the arbitrator. If the claim exceeds $10,000, a party’s right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in English, closed to the public, and confidential. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. All documents and information exchanged by the parties during arbitration are confidential information and will be kept confidential. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be as set forth in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. An arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the demand was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (determined by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

The only exception to the Arbitration Agreement is that either of us may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). You may reject this Arbitration Agreement by providing us with written notice of such rejection within 30 days of your first access to the Services or of the date a change to this Arbitration Agreement became effective. In order to be effective notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have or may enter in the future with us. **YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR SIMILAR ACTION, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW. YOU AND THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.** Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (**\"AAA\"**) in accordance with the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the **\"AAA Rules\"**) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. (**\"FAA\"**), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of New York. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. If the claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents we submit to the arbitrator. If the claim exceeds $10,000, a party's right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in English, closed to the public, and confidential. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. All documents and information exchanged by the parties during arbitration are confidential information and will be kept confidential. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be as set forth in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. An arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the demand was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (determined by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. These Terms, and the Arbitration Agreement, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. All litigation, court proceedings, arbitration proceedings, mediation proceedings, lawsuits, court hearings, and other hearings or actions initiated in connection with these Terms must and will be exclusively held in New York. \n\n## Limitation on Time to File Claims\n\n**ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THIS WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.**\n\n## Waiver and Severability\n\nNo waiver by roadmap.sh of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of roadmap.sh to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. \n\n## Entire Agreement\n\nThe Terms of Use, the Terms of Sale and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and roadmap.sh regarding this Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding this Website. \n\n## Your Comments and Concerns\n\nThis website is operated by Insight Media Group, LLC. \n\n## Contact Us\n\n**Roadmap.sh**\n548 Market Street\nPMB 50938\nSan Francisco, CA, US\n\n**Google Voice:** 707-653-5505\n**Toll-free:** (844) 503-3215\n";
