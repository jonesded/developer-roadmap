<p>Getting ready for a software developer interview is never easy, especially if you’re new to the main tech stack of the company. This is why understanding the type of questions you might get asked during a technical interview is one of the keys to success.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll go over 50 popular backend interview questions ordered by experience level.</p>
<p>For each question, we’ll provide some explanations, but feel free to further research each topic in detail, or go to the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">Backend Roadmap</a> if you’re looking for a place to get started in your learning journey.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-your-backend-interview">Preparing for your Backend interview</h2>
<p>Before we get started, it’s important to remember the following points when getting ready for your backend technical interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover the basics of backend development. If you’re going for a web dev role, make sure you understand how client-server communication works. If you’re going for a dev tool development, understand the best practices around CLI development, etc.</li>
<li>Practice coding, either by completing <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> or by using sites such as <a href="https://leetcode.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, <a href="https://hackerrank.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HackerRank</a>, and others.</li>
<li>Consider reading up on software architecture; even if your role won’t be that of an architect, you’ll show understanding on a higher level by being able to discuss these topics.</li>
<li>Make sure you have, at least, a basic understanding of most of the foundational layer of tools and practices for your role, such as version management (i.e. using Git), testing (as in unit testing at least), <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> (including CI/CD pipelines, etc.), and anything else related to your role and the company.</li>
<li>On a more general note, remember to read up on the company to be able to show interest and understanding of their business/product and also come prepared with a couple of questions of your own, showing you care about the role and the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data science interviews are in a league of their own. You’re expected to juggle statistics, programming, and business thinking, all at once. Even seasoned professionals need tailored preparation, as these interviews assess more than domain knowledge. They test how you think, solve problems, keep up with trends, and communicate your results on the spot.</p>
<p>This guide is comprehensive, with 60+ common data science interview questions and answers, and some common missteps that trip up experienced candidates. These questions are categorized into three key areas: conceptual knowledge (statistics, machine learning, data wrangling), coding skills (Python and SQL), and business communication (process explanation and solution alignment).</p>
<p>To help you practice smarter, I’ve included flashcards for active recall and self-testing. Want to go deeper? Check out the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist" target="_blank">data science roadmap</a> to strengthen the foundations behind your answers.

<p>The evolution of technology and practices, coupled with the increase in complexity of the systems we develop, make the role of DevOps more relevant by the day.</p>
<p>But becoming a successful DevOps engineer is not a trivial task, especially because this role is usually the evolution of a developer looking to get more involved in other related ops areas or someone from ops who’s starting to get more directly involved in the development space.</p>
<p>Either way, DevOps engineers work between the development and operations teams, understanding enough about each area to be able to work towards improving their interactions.</p>
<p>Because of this strange situation, while detailed roadmaps (be sure to check out our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps roadmap</a>!) help a lot, getting ready for a DevOps interview requires a lot of work.</p>
<p>Lastly, Checkout our Devops <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects" target="_blank">Projects</a> to test your real world knowledge.</p>
<p>Here are the most relevant DevOps interview questions you’ll likely get asked during a DevOps interview, plus a few more that will push your skills to the next level.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-your-devops-interview">Preparing for your DevOps interview</h2>
<p>Before diving into your DevOps technical interview, keep these key points in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand the core concepts</strong>: Familiarize yourself with the essentials of DevOps practices, including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), the software development lifecycle, and containerization. Understand how these concepts contribute to the overall development lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Practice hands-on skills</strong>: There is a lot of practical knowledge involved in the DevOps practice, so make sure you try what you read about. Set up some CI/CD pipelines for your pet projects, understand containerization, and pick a tool to get started. The more you practice, the more prepared you’ll be for real-world problems.</li>
<li><strong>Study software architecture</strong>: While you may not have the responsibilities of an architect, having a solid understanding of software architecture principles can be a huge help. Being able to discuss the different components of a system with architects would make you a huge asset to any team.</li>
<li><strong>Research the Company</strong>: In general, it’s always a great idea to research the company you’re interviewing for. In this case, investigate the company’s DevOps practices, the technologies they use, and their overall approach to software development. This will help you demonstrate a genuine interest in their operations and come prepared with thoughtful questions.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever since Golang (also known as “Go”) was released in 2012, developers have been taking advantage of its many pros around its concurrent programming model, and the language’s simplicity.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to become a Go developer,  this list of Golang interview questions will help you prepare for the role. From basic types and variable declaration in Go to advanced allocation techniques in the memory space and error-handling strategies, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>So sit back and relax, because the preparation process is going to take a while, but the results are going to be great!</p>
<h2 id="getting-ready-for-your-next-interview">Getting ready for your next interview</h2>
<p>Preparing for a Golang interview involves more than just memorizing the words “main import” and “func main”. You need to understand how calling functions work, how variables receive their zero value, and how types and composite types work together.</p>
<p>As a good rule of thumb, you’d want to practice writing unit tests using the built-in testing package, and don’t forget to focus on properly managing your errors, defining your own error types (when it makes sense), and carefully managing your dependencies. Those are all details that tend to get ignored or trivialized by inexperienced developers (and you don’t want to look like one!).</p>`,sn={order:4,briefTitle:"Golang",briefDescription:"Test, Rate and Improve your Full-stack knowledge with these questions.",title:"50 Popular Golang Interview Questions (+ Quiz!)",description:"Ace your Go interview with confidence!

If an error occurs while reading the file, the `err` argument will contain the error object. Otherwise, the `data` argument will contain the contents of the file.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to load environment variables from a `.env` file in Node.js?",answer:"The `dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It is used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, etc. in a `.env` file instead of hardcoding them in the source code.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to access environment variables in Node.js?",answer:"Environment variables can be accessed using the `process.env` object. It is an object that contains all the environment variables defined in the current process.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to take user input from the command line in Node.js?",answer:"input-from-command-line.md",topics:["CLI","Beginner"]},{question:"How to create a web server in Node.js?",answer:"web-server.md",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What are streams in Node.js?",answer:`Streams are objects that allow you to read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner. They are used to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
`,topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"What is difference between `fork` and `spawn` methods of `child_process` module?",answer:"The `fork` method is used when you want to run another JavaScript file in a separate worker. It's like having a friend with a specific task. You can communicate with them via messages and they can send messages back to you. The `spawn` method is used when you want to run a command in a separate process. It's like asking someone to do a specific. You can communicate with them via stdin/stdout/stderr, but it's more like giving orders and getting results.\n",topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"What is the `os` module?",answer:"The `os` module provides methods for interacting with the operating system. It can be used to get information about the operating system, such as the hostname, platform, architecture, etc.\n",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"Can you access the DOM in Node.js?",answer:`No, you cannot access the DOM in Node.js because it does not have a DOM. It is a server-side runtime for JavaScript, so it does not have access to the browser's DOM.
`,topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is Clustering in Node.js?",answer:`Clustering is a technique used to distribute the load across multiple processes. It is used to improve the performance and scalability of Node.js applications.
`,topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"How can memory leaks happen in Node.js?",answer:`Memory leaks happen when a program allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed. This can happen due to bugs in the program or due to the way the program is designed. In Node.js, memory leaks can happen due to the use of closures, circular references, and global variables.

It was developed and is maintained by Meta, and is widely used by developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications.",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What are the features of React?",answer:"Use of Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM, JSX, Server-side rendering, Unidirectional data flow or data binding, Reusable components, etc.",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is JSX?",answer:"JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript objects.",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?",answer:`Virtual DOM is the representation of a UI in the form of a plain JavaScript object. It is a node tree that lists the elements, their attributes and content as Objects and their properties. Real DOM is the real representation of a UI which can be seen and inspected in the browser.
Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster than real DOM, because nothing gets drawn on the screen. React uses this virtual DOM to figure out the most efficient way to update the browser DOM.
`,topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the difference between state and props?",answer:`Props are used to pass data from parent to child. They are like function arguments. They are immutable.
State is managed within the component and is mutable.
`,topics:["State","Beginner"]},{question:"Can we change the state of the component directly?",answer:"No, we can't change the state of the component directly. State can only be changed by using `setState()` method. Changing the state variable directly won't re-render the component.",topics:["State","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",answer:"controlled-vs-uncontrolled.md",topics:["State","Beginner"]},{question:"What are different options to style a React component?",answer:"CSS Stylesheets, Inline styles, CSS Modules, Styled Components, CSS in JS libraries, etc.",topics:["Styling","Beginner"]},{question:"What are Pure Components?",answer:"pure-components.md",topics:["Performance","Intermediate"]},{question:"What are Synthetic Events in React?",answer:"synthetic-events.md",topics:["Events","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is the purpose of `key` attribute in React?",answer:"The string attribute `key` is a special attribute you need to include when rendering an array of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.",topics:["Performance","Beginner"]},{question:"What are refs in React?",answer:`Refs are used to get reference to a DOM node or an instance of a component. They help to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
You can also use refs when you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a ref.
`,topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is ref forwarding in React?",answer:"ref-forwarding.md",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is React Fiber?",answer:`React fiber is the reconciliation engine that replaced the core algorithm in React v16. It is a rewrite of the core algorithm, responsible for scheduling what gets rendered on screen. It is a set of algorithms for efficiently updating the UI.
Here is a [bit-outdated but quite good article about React Fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture).
`,topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"What is the difference between react and react-dom packages?",answer:"React is a library for building user interfaces. The package `react` contains only the renderer-agnostic code i.e. the core React library, algorithm for computing changes in the UI and other helpers. The package `react-dom` contains the code specific to the DOM rendering of React components.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the difference between class components and function components?",answer:"Class components let you define your components with the help of classes. You can extend from `React.Component` class to create a component. Class components also allow you to define component level lifecycle methods.\nFunction components are defined by writing a function which returns a React element. Functional components are the preferred way to write React components. There are no lifecycle methods similar to class components available in functional components; you can use React hooks instead to manage the component lifecycle.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?",answer:`A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.
Higher-Order Components are not part of the React API. They are the pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.
`,topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What are React Hooks?",answer:"Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. Some common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, etc.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to render HTML in React?",answer:"You can use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop to render HTML in React. It is used to set HTML directly from React. You should be careful while using this property as it can cause XSS attacks.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is Context in React?",answer:`Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
`,topics:["State","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is Reconciliation in React?",answer:`Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM by comparing the newly returned elements with the previously rendered ones. React updates the DOM when a component's state changes.
`,topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What could be the reasons for un-necessary re-renders in React?",answer:"re-renders.md",topics:["Performance","Intermediate"]},{question:"How does React handle prop drilling, and what are the downsides of excessive prop drilling?",answer:"Prop drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through props. While React doesn't prohibit this, it can lead to code that is hard to maintain and understand. Excessive prop drilling can make it challenging to track data flow and can result in unnecessary re-renders. To mitigate these issues, you can use Context API or state management libraries like Redux.",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in React?",answer:`The useEffect hook in React is used for performing side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscribing to external data sources.
`,topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is the purpose of the `useContext` hook in React?",answer:`The useContext hook is used to access and consume context values in functional components. It provides a way to access context data without the need for a context consumer. useContext is particularly useful when you want to access context values in nested components without having to pass props through intermediate components.
`,topics:["State","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in React?",answer:"The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of a computationally expensive operation in a functional component. It helps optimize performance by caching the result of the operation and returning the cached result on subsequent renders if the dependencies have not changed. This can prevent unnecessary calculations.\n",topics:["Performance","Intermediate"]},{question:"Explain the concept of error boundaries in React.",answer:"error-boundaries.md",topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"What are fragments in React?",answer:`React doesn't allow returning multiple elements from a component. You can use fragments to return multiple elements.

Fragments in React allow for a group of elements to be returned from a component's render method without adding an extra node to the DOM. They are useful when you want to return multiple elements without wrapping them in a parent container.
`,topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What are portals in React?",answer:"create-portal.md",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is Concurrent React (Concurrent Mode)?",answer:`Concurrent React, previously referred to as Concurrent Mode, is a set of new features in React that allows React to interrupt the rendering process to consider more urgent tasks, making it possible for React to be more responsive to user input and produce smoother user experiences. It lets React keep the UI responsive while rendering large component trees by splitting the rendering work into smaller chunks and spreading it over multiple frames.
`,topics:["Performance","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is the `useTransition` hook?",answer:"use-transition.md",topics:["Performance","Advanced"]},{question:"What is the purpose of `flushSync` in React?",answer:"flush-sync.md",topics:["Core","Advanced"]},{question:"How to render React components as static HTML string?",answer:"The `renderToString` function in React is part of the `react-dom/server` package and is used to render React components on the server-side to a static HTML string. It is commonly used for server-side rendering (SSR) in React.\n",topics:["SSR","Intermediate"]},{question:"What are Server Components in React?",answer:`Server Components allow developers to write components that render on the server instead of the client. Unlike traditional components, Server Components do not have a client-side runtime, meaning they result in a smaller bundle size and faster loads. They can seamlessly integrate with client components and can fetch data directly from the backend without the need for an API layer. This enables developers to build rich, interactive apps with less client-side code, improving performance and developer experience.
`,topics:["SSR","Intermediate"]},{question:"How to lazy load components in React?",answer:"lazy-loading.md",topics:["Performance","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is `Suspense` in React?",answer:"suspense.md",topics:["UX","Intermediate"]},{question:"How does React Virtual DOM work?",answer:"virtual-dom.md",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"How do Server Components differ from Client Components?",answer:"Server Components are rendered on the server and do not require client-side JavaScript for rendering. While Server Components and Client components can coexist in the same app, Server Components can import and render Client components.",topics:["SSR","Beginner"]},{question:"How do React Server Components handle data fetching?",answer:"Server Components can directly access backend resources, databases, or filesystems to fetch data during rendering, eliminating the need for a separate API layer for data fetching.",topics:["SSR","Beginner"]},{question:"What's the component's lifecycle in React?",answer:"component-lifecycle.md",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to write a comment in React?",answer:"You can write a comment in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces and using JavaScript's multi-line comment syntax.\n```js\n{/* This is a comment */}\n```\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the difference between stateful and stateless components?",answer:"The main difference between stateful and stateless components is one has state and the other doesn't. Stateful components keep track of changes to their state and re-render themselves when the state changes. Stateless components, on the other hand, render whatever is passed to them via `props` or always render the same thing.\n",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"Why you shouldn't use `index` as a key in React lists and iterators?",answer:"Using `index` as a key can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with the component state. When the list items change due to additions, deletions, or reordering, using indexes can lead to unnecessary re-renders or even incorrect UI updates. React uses keys to identify elements in the list, and if the key is just an index, it might reuse component instances and state inappropriately. Especially in cases where the list is dynamic or items can be reordered, it's recommended to use unique and stable identifiers as keys to ensure consistent behavior.",topics:["Performance","Beginner"]},{question:"What is the naming convention for React components?",answer:"In React, the naming convention for components is to use PascalCase, meaning the first letter of each word in the component's name should be capitalized. For example, `UserProfile`, `SidebarItem`, or `NavigationMenu`. This convention differentiates custom React components from regular HTML tags in JSX, as React treats elements starting with a lowercase letter as DOM tags and those starting with a capital letter as custom components.",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"How to render a list in React?",answer:"render-list.md",topics:["Core","Beginner"]},{question:"What are `use client` and `use server` directives?",answer:"The `use client` directive marks source files whose components are intended to execute only on the client. Conversely, `use server` marks server-side functions that can be invoked from client-side code.",topics:["SSR","Intermediate"]},{question:"Can you use hooks in Server Components?",answer:"No, hooks are not supported in Server Components. Hooks are a client-side feature and are not supported in Server Components. However, you can use hooks in client components and import them into Server Components.",topics:["SSR","Intermediate"]},{question:"How to create a Custom hook in React?",answer:"custom-hook.md",topics:["Core","Intermediate"]},{question:"What is Hydration in React?",answer:`Hydration is the process of using client-side JavaScript to add interactivity to the markup generated by the server. When you use server-side rendering, the server returns a static HTML representation of the component tree. Once this reaches the browser, in order to make it interactive, React "hydrates" the static content, turning it into a fully interactive application.

<h2 id="getting-ready-for-your-sql-interview">Getting ready for your SQL interview</h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.” It couldn’t be more true when it comes to interviews. Before practicing questions, ensure you’ve got the basics covered. Here are a few key areas you’ll want to brush up on before heading into your interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read up on core SQL concepts like data types, statements, and clauses.</li>
<li>Practice working with tables. Joining tables using different types of joins, along with clauses like <code>ON</code> and <code>USING</code>, is key to retrieving and aggregating data.</li>
<li>Get comfortable with data manipulation tasks like inserting, updating, and deleting records.</li>
<li>Learn the fundamentals of database design, including normalization, constraints, and performance tuning.</li>
<li>Beyond syntax, sharpen your problem-solving, logical thinking, and communication skills. Interviews often test how clearly you explain your thought process, not just how well you write code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="icebreaker-sql-questions">Icebreaker SQL questions</h2>
<p>Before exploring technical questions, some interviewers might start with general ones like “How long have you been working with SQL?”, “How would you rate your proficiency in SQL on a scale?”, or “What are some common SQL syntax used for data manipulation?” These questions often help start the conversation and make you feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>Even if this information is already in your CV or resume, be ready to speak about it. Practice giving crisp and honest answers that capture your SQL experience.</p>

<h2 id="cons-of-a-career-in-data-science">Cons of a Career in Data Science</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-right-fit-x50z5.png" alt="Cons of a Career in Data Science"></p>
<p>The data science job is not without its “cons”, after all, there is no “perfect” role out there. Let’s now review some of the potential challenges that come with the role.</p>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve">Steep Learning Curve</h3>
<p>The steep learning curve in data science is one of the field’s defining characteristics. New data scientists have to develop a deep understanding of technical skills, including proficiency in programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, as well as tools for machine learning and data visualization.</p>
<p>On top of the already complex subjects to master, data scientists need to find ways of staying current with the constant advancements in the field. This is not optional; it’s a necessity for anyone trying to achieve long-term success in data science. This constant evolution can feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers who are also learning foundational skills.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the steep learning curve can be incredibly rewarding for those who are passionate about solving problems, making data-driven decisions, and contributing to impactful projects.</p>
<p>While it might sound harsh, it’s important to note that the dedication required to overcome these challenges often results in a fulfilling and (extremely) lucrative career in the world of data science.</p>
<h3 id="high-expectations">High Expectations</h3>
<p>Data science positions come with high expectations from organizations. Data scientists usually have the huge responsibility of delivering actionable insights and ensuring these insights are both accurate and timely.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges data science professionals face is managing the pressure to deliver results under tight deadlines (they’re always tight). Stakeholders often expect instant answers to complex problems, which can lead to unrealistic demands.</p>
<p>To succeed in such environments, skilled data scientists need strong communication skills to explain their findings and set realistic expectations with stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="potential-burnout">Potential Burnout</h3>
<p>The high demand for data science skills usually translates into heavy workloads and tight deadlines, particularly for data scientists working on high-stakes projects (working extra hours is also not an uncommon scenario).</p>
<p>Data scientists frequently juggle multiple complex responsibilities, such as modeling data, developing machine learning algorithms, and conducting statistical analysis—often within limited timeframes.</p>
<p>The intense focus required for these tasks, combined with overlapping priorities (and a small dose of poor project management), can lead to mental fatigue and stress.</p>
<p>Work-life balance can also be a challenge for data scientists giving them another reason for burnout. Combine that with highly active industries, like finance and you have a very hard-to-balance combination.</p>
<p>To mitigate the risk of burnout, data scientists can try to prioritize setting boundaries, managing workloads effectively (when that’s an option), and advocating for clearer role definitions (better separation of concerns).</p>
<h2 id="skills-required-for-a-data-science-career">Skills Required for a Data Science Career</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-skills-6i284.png" alt="Skills Required for a Data Science Career"></p>
<p>To develop a successful career in data science, not all of your <a href="https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist/skills" target="_blank">skills</a> need to be technical, you also have to look at soft skills, and domain knowledge and to have a mentality of lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h3 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h3>
<p>The field of data requires strong foundational technical skills. At the core of these skills is proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. Python is particularly useful and liked for its versatility and extensive libraries, while SQL is essential for querying and managing database systems. R remains a popular choice for statistical analysis and data visualization.</p>
<p>In terms of frameworks, look into TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn. They’re all crucial for building predictive models and implementing artificial intelligence solutions. Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib are fantastic for creating clear and effective data visualizations, which play a significant role in presenting actionable insights.</p>
<h3 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h3>
<p>As I said before, it’s not all about technical skills. Data scientists must develop their soft skills, this is key in the field.</p>
<p>From problem-solving and analytical thinking to developing your communication skills and your ability to collaborate with others. They all work together to help you communicate complex insights and results to other, non-technical stakeholders, which is going to be a key activity in your day-to-day life.</p>
<h3 id="domain-knowledge">Domain Knowledge</h3>
<p>While technical and soft skills are essential, domain knowledge often distinguishes exceptional data scientists from the rest. Understanding industry-specific contexts—such as healthcare regulations, financial market trends, or retail customer behavior—enables data scientists to deliver tailored insights that directly address business needs. If you understand your problem space, you understand the needs of your client and the data you’re dealing with.</p>
<p>Getting that domain knowledge often involves on-the-job experience, targeted research, or additional certifications.</p>
<h3 id="lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</h3>
<p>Finally, if you’re going to be a data scientist, you’ll need to embrace a mindset of continuous learning. The field evolves rapidly, with emerging technologies, tools, and methodologies reshaping best practices. Staying competitive requires consistent professional development through online courses, certifications, conferences, and engagement with the broader data science community.</p>
<p>Lifelong learning is not just a necessity but also an opportunity to remain excited and engaged in a dynamic and rewarding career.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-determine-if-data-science-is-right-for-you">How to determine if data science is right for you?</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-right-fit-x50z5.png" alt="Is data science right for you?"></p>
<p>How can you tell if you’ll actually enjoy working as a data scientist? Even after reading this far, you might still have some doubts. So in this section, I’m going to look at some ways in which you can validate that you’ll enjoy the job of a data scientist before you go through the process of becoming one.</p>
<h3 id="self-assessment-questions">Self-Assessment Questions</h3>
<p>Figuring out whether data science is the right career path starts with introspection. Ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you enjoy working with numbers and solving complex problems?</li>
<li>Are you comfortable learning and applying programming skills like Python and SQL?</li>
<li>Are you excited by the idea of using algorithms to create data-driven insights and actionable recommendations?</li>
<li>Are you willing to commit to continuous learning in a fast-evolving field?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take your time while you think about these questions. You don’t even need a full answer, just try to understand how you feel about the idea of each one. If you don’t feel like saying “yes”, then chances are, this might not be the right path for you (and that’s completely fine!).</p>
<h3 id="start-with-small-projects">Start with Small Projects</h3>
<p>If self-assessment is not your thing, another great way to explore your interest in data science is to dive into small, manageable projects. Platforms like Kaggle offer competitions and publicly available data sets, allowing you to practice exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling. Working on these projects can help you build a portfolio, develop confidence in your skills, and validate that you effectively like working this way.</p>

<h2 id="10-feature-engineering-and-selection-for-model-optimization">10. Feature engineering and selection for model optimization</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/feature-engineering-1pit4.png" alt="Feature engineering and selection"></p>
<p>For machine learning models to interpret and use any type of data, that data needs to be turned into features. And that is where feature engineering and selection comes into play. These are two critical steps in the data science workflow because they directly influence the performance and accuracy of the models. If you think about it, the better the model understands what data to focus on, the better it’ll perform.</p>
<p>These processes involve creating, selecting, and transforming raw data into useful features loaded with meaning that help represent the underlying problem for the model.</p>
<p>For example, imagine building a model to predict house prices. Raw data might include information like the size of the house in square meters, the number of rooms, and the year it was built. Through feature engineering, a data scientist could create new features, such as “price per square meter” or “age of the house,” which make the data more informative for the model. These features can highlight trends that a model might otherwise miss.</p>
<p>Feature selection, on the other hand, focuses on optimizing the use and dependency on features by identifying the most relevant ones and removing the redundant or irrelevant features. For example, let’s consider a retail scenario where a model is predicting customer churn, here it might benefit from focusing on features like “purchase frequency” and “customer feedback sentiment”, while ignoring less impactful ones like “the time of day purchases are made”. This helps to avoid the model getting overwhelmed by noise, improving both its efficiency and accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to improve your data science game, then focusing on feature engineering and selection can definitely have that effect.</p>

It uses structured data like customer databases to identify patterns and solve complex problems. You’ll use advanced tools and machine learning techniques like computer vision to work with unstructured data like videos and images.</p>
<p>If you choose data science, you’ll work on extracting valuable insights from data. For example, a data scientist working in finance will use anomaly detection to analyze transactional data. This helps with fraud detection and risk assessment, e.g., unusual login attempts.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/primary-focus-between-data-science-and-ai-l4fv0.png" alt="Data science vs. artificial intelligence: Primary focus"></p>
<p>In contrast, if you choose artificial intelligence, you’ll focus on building systems that mimic human intelligence, like learning, reasoning, and solving problems. It uses structured and unstructured data to enable machines to perform tasks like pattern recognition in images and speech and natural language processing. For example, AI virtual assistants like Siri can listen and reply to what you’re saying. They use natural language processing models to recognize and understand your voice (human language). It makes it easy for you to ask and get answers to questions just by talking.</p>
<h2 id="daily-responsibilities">Daily responsibilities</h2>
<p>Data scientists and AI engineers have different responsibilities that show their focus areas. As a data scientist, your daily duties will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data collection</strong>: This is often the first thing you do when extracting insights from data. Your job will be to collect large volumes of data from several sources, such as databases. For example, a healthcare data scientist will collect and analyze patient data to create models to help in diagnosing diseases. It’ll make it easier to predict patient outcomes and make treatment plans better.</li>
<li><strong>Data cleaning</strong>: After you collect all the data, the next step is to clean the data. Doing this means removing errors from the raw data to prepare it for data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Data analysis</strong>: After cleaning, you’ll analyze data to identify patterns and trends. You’ll do this using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques like clustering.</li>
<li><strong>Building models</strong>: You’ll create predictive models to make future predictions based on historical data. A company like Netflix, for example, uses predictive models to suggest TV shows and movies to you. The data scientist will analyze your past data to see what shows you’ve watched, how you rated them, and more. Then, they will use this data to build a model that suggests similar shows you’ll like.</li>
<li><strong>Data visualization</strong>: Visualizing data is about presenting complex data in a visual format. As a data scientist, you’ll use data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to present data in a way that every team member will understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/responsibilities-of-a-data-scientist-and-ai-engineer-wzlzh.png" alt="Data science vs. artificial intelligence: Job responsibilities"></p>
<p>On the flip side, AI involves various responsibilities like designing, training, and testing AI models. As an AI engineer, your daily responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data preparation</strong>: You’ll collect, clean, analyze, and work with large amounts of data to train and test AI models (i.e., machine learning models). Yes, as an AI engineer, you’ll also analyze data, although it is the primary duty of the data scientists. Doing this lets you check if the data is good for the AI model and spot any problems that could mess up the training.</li>
<li><strong>Model training</strong>: You’ll be responsible for developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from data using machine learning techniques like computer vision and neural networks. For example, automotive industries use artificial intelligence to create self-driving cars. They use AI algorithms to analyze sensor data from cameras, radar, and lasers to see what’s around them.</li>
<li><strong>Review models</strong>: You’ll test and make sure that the models provide reliable results. Imagine you’ve developed a model to identify diseases from analyzing medical images. You’ll use images the model hasn’t seen before to test its accuracy at spotting diseases. If it misses something, that’s your cue to tweak it until it gets better.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Once you create a model, you need to make sure it works well with other systems. It’s like having a chatbot on a website to handle customer inquiries, using a fraud detection system in a bank to analyze transactions, or incorporating GPS functionality in self-driving cars for navigation. Additionally, you’ll monitor and maintain its performance and update it when needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Business analytics might be a better fit if you don’t fancy data science. You’ll sit at the intersection of business, data, and operations. You are responsible for evaluating the business’s overall health, identifying gaps, and recommending solutions to improve business operations.</p>
<p>You’ll also perform basic data cleaning and transformation using tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/sql" target="_blank">SQL</a> and Excel. However, your primary focus is analyzing data to uncover insights, create reports, and present findings to stakeholders.</p>
<p>Beyond analysis, I realized that business analysts also take action. You’ll recommend strategic next steps based on data insights and collaborate with decision-makers to execute them. This means being involved in change strategy and ensuring that insights lead to tangible business improvements.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you work for an energy company and notice a drop in residential electricity usage due to increased solar panel adoption. A data scientist will build predictive models to forecast energy demand, optimize distribution, and detect anomalies. A business analyst, meanwhile, will interpret these insights, develop strategies like solar buyback programs, and lead their implementation to drive impact.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-their-similarities">What Are Their Similarities?</h2>
<p>Although data science and business analytics have differences, after working in both fields, I realized that they share the same goal. Both disciplines focus on transforming raw data into valuable insights that drive business decisions.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-vs-business-analytics-what-connects-them-z10j8.png" alt="Data science vs business analytics: what connects them?"></p>

<p>Whether your goal is to become a backend developer or to stay relevant as one, the goal itself requires adopting an eternal student mindset. The ever-evolving web development space demands continuous learning, regardless of the programming language you use. New frameworks, libraries, and methodologies emerge regularly, offering different solutions to old problems. To remain relevant as a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend developer</a>, you’ll have to stay updated by honing your core skills.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll cover the following set of backend developer skills we recommend you aim for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping an eye on core and new backend programming languages</li>
<li>Understanding the basics of software design and architecture</li>
<li>Understanding databases and how to use them</li>
<li>API development</li>
<li>The basics of version control</li>
<li>Testing and debugging</li>
<li>CI/CD and DevOps fundamentals</li>
<li>Soft skills</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s get going!</p>
<h2 id="understanding-backend-development">Understanding Backend Development</h2>
<p>Before we move on and start discussing the different backend development skills you should focus on, let’s first understand what a backend developer is. After all, if you’re looking to actually become a backend developer, you’ll need this.</p>
<p>A backend developer focuses entirely on writing business logic for an application and much of the supporting logic as well.</p>
<p>That said, there might be applications where the business logic is split into the frontend and the backend. However, while the frontend dev might have to share their time between UI code and business logic, the backend dev will focus most of their time on core business logic. That’s the main difference between the two.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709056806118.png" alt="UI vs Backend"></p>
<p>In the above image, you can see how there is a lot more behind the curtain than just the UI when it comes to web applications. In this case, a “simple” log-in form needs a backend to contain its core business logic.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the most in-demand backend developer skills you should focus on in backend development.</p>
<h2 id="proficiency-in-core-and-emerging-programming-languages">Proficiency in Core and Emerging Programming Languages</h2>
<p>One of the most basic skills you should focus on as a backend developer is on identifying key programming languages to learn (or at least keep an eye out for).</p>
<p>There are some essential backend languages that the industry has adopted as de facto standards. This means most new projects are usually coded using one (or multiple) of these programming languages.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058292005.png" alt="core-languages"></p>
<p>The most common names you should look out for are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript (or any of its variants, such as TypeScript).</strong> This is a very common option because it’s also the language used by frontend developers, thus making it easier for developers to work on both sides of the same project.</li>
<li><strong>Python.</strong> While a very common option for other types of projects (such as data processing and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist" target="_blank">data science</a>), it’s still very popular in the web development world. Python has many good qualities and supporting frameworks that make it a very easy-to-pick-up option for coding backend systems.</li>
<li><strong>Go (A.K.A Golang).</strong> This programming language was developed by Google. It was designed with simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency in mind. That’s made it gain popularity in the backend development space, making it an interesting option for projects that prioritize performance and concurrency.</li>
<li><strong>Java.</strong> One of the most common alternatives for enterprise solutions, Java, has been constantly evolving since its first release back in 1995. All that time making its way into big enterprises that trust its robustness and ever-growing community of developers. While not the easiest language to learn, it’s definitely up there in the top 10 most popular <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/languages" target="_blank">backend languages</a> (according to <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">StackOverflow’s 2023 Developer survey</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are other options, the ones mentioned above, from the backend point of view, are some of the most relevant languages to pay attention to. Here are the top 10 most popular ones amongst professional developers (screenshot taken from SO’s survey of 2023):</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057007054.png" alt="StackOverflow Survey Result"></p>
<h3 id="keeping-an-eye-on-the-rising-stars">Keeping an eye on the rising stars</h3>
<p>If working with at least one of the most common backend languages was important, understanding what are the rising technologies in the backend world is just as crucial.</p>
<p>You won’t see a new programming language being released every month. However, in the span of a few years, you might see the release of several, and out of those, some might stick long enough to become new standards.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the period between 2012 and 2015; in just 3 years, 9 programming languages were released, out of which most of them are being used to this day.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058257292.png" alt="Famous Languages"></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2012, we got Julia, Elm, Go, and TypeScript.</li>
<li>In 2013, we got Dart</li>
<li>In 2014, we got Swift, Hack, and Crystal</li>
<li>And in 2015, we got Rust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those languages are very relevant to this day, such as TypeScript and Rust, while others, such as Hack and Crystal, might be known to only a few in very niche sectors.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s impossible to predict which programming language will become a standard. However, the skill that you need to hone is that of keeping an eye on the industry to spot new and emerging trends.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-supporting-frameworks">The importance of supporting frameworks</h3>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/frameworks" target="_blank">Frameworks</a> for a specific programming language do change a lot faster than the language itself, though.</p>
<p>Frameworks are there to provide you with a simplified gateway into the functionalities that you’d normally need for common tasks. For example, in the context of backend web development, frameworks usually take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parsing HTTP requests</strong> and turning them into objects you can easily interact with (so you don’t have to learn how the HTTP protocol works).</li>
<li><strong>Abstracting concepts,</strong> such as a request or a response, into objects and functions that you can reason about at a higher level. This gives you an easier time thinking about how to solve a problem using these tools.</li>
<li><strong>Accessing data becomes a lot easier when there are abstractions.</strong> Some frameworks provide what is known as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping). Through ORM, you can interact with databases without having to think about writing SQL queries or even database schemas.</li>
<li>And many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frameworks are an essential aspect of the work you’ll do as a backend developer, which is why you should not neglect them. Of course, learning and mastering every single framework out there is impossible. Instead, learn to keep an eye out in the industry and see what are the most common frameworks, and focus on one (or two) of them.</p>
<h2 id="software-design-and-architecture">Software Design and Architecture</h2>
<p>Coding is not just about writing code.</p>
<p>While that statement might be a bit confusing, the truth is there is a lot of architecture involved in software development (both in frontend and backend development). Sometimes, working on these aspects of a system is the job of a specific role called “architect.” However, for backend systems, it’s not uncommon for backend developers to also be involved in architecture conversations and decisions. You’re helping design the underlying backend infrastructure, after all.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows an example of what a very simple system’s architecture might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057266440.png" alt="Simple System Architecture"></p>
<p>While the example is oversimplified, it gives you an idea of what the practice of “architecting a system” is.</p>
<p>Essentially, architecting a system means coming up with concepts that represent different aspects of the solution and then deciding how you want to make them interact with each other.</p>
<p>Why is architecture so important here? Because it gives you properties such as code encapsulation, separation of concerns, reusability, and even scalability as a byproduct of the architecture itself.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at some of the most common architectures used for creating backend systems.</p>
<h3 id="most-common-backend-architectures">Most common backend architectures</h3>
<p>There are too many different architectural styles and patterns to cover them all inside a single article, but let’s just look at some of the most common ones and how they can help you while working on your backend system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic architecture:</strong> In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, tightly coupled unit. All components (frontend, backend, database, etc) are part of the same codebase. This is a great first architecture because it feels very natural to develop under, and if your project is not going to grow out of proportion, then you will probably not hit any of the cons.</li>
<li><strong>Microservice-based architecture:</strong> The application is divided into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. These services communicate through APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture:</strong> Similar to microservices, a service-oriented architecture splits functionality into individual services. The main difference is that these services aren’t as granular as a microservice, so they might incorporate functionalities related to different business entities.</li>
<li><strong>Event-driven architecture:</strong> With this architecture, each system (or service) responds to events (e.g., user actions and messages from other services) by triggering actions or processes. All services communicate with each other indirectly through an event bus (also known as a “message bus”), so it removes the possibility of having two or more services coupled with each other (meaning that they can’t be treated individually).</li>
<li><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> Also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), serverless architecture allows you to focus on writing code without worrying about the server where they’ll run. Functions are executed in response to events without the need for provisioning or managing servers (this is done FOR you automatically).</li>
<li><strong>Microkernel architecture:</strong> This architecture lets you build the core, essential functionality into a small microkernel and have the rest of the features built as plugins that can be added, removed or exchanged easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to know more about the patterns and principles mentioned here, please check out the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture" target="_blank">Software Design and Architecture roadmap</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mastery-of-database-management-systems">Mastery of Database Management Systems</h2>
<p>As a backend developer, you will undoubtedly have to deal with database administration in your daily tasks. They are the industry standard for storing persistent data.</p>
<p>Because of that, it’s important to understand that you should be aware of two main categories of databases: SQL databases and NoSQL databases.</p>
<h3 id="sql-databases">SQL databases</h3>
<p>These are the standard structured databases (A.K.A relational databases) where you need to define the schema for your data (essentially the data structures you’re dealing with), and then you’ll use a language called <a href="https://roadmap.sh/sql" target="_blank">SQL (Structured Query Language)</a> to interact with the data inside it. Most backend developers will interact with SQL databases at some point in their career, as this is the most common type of database.</p>
<h3 id="nosql-databases">NoSQL databases</h3>
<p>As the name implies, these are not your standard SQL databases; in fact, within this category, there are columnar databases, document-based ones (such as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>), key-value-based ones (like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/redis" target="_blank">Redis</a>), and more. They don’t use predefined data structures, giving you more flexibility and control over what you can store and how you store it. Backend developers will deal with only a handful of these, as there are many different sub-types, and more are created every year.</p>
<p>Some examples of these databases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>MongoDB, a document-based database (see here a mongoDB roadmap if you’re interested).</li>
<li>Redis, an in-memory key-value pair database.</li>
<li>Neo4J, a graph database.</li>
<li>ElasticSearch, a document-based search engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the decision between SQL and NoSQL is about trade-offs and figuring out what works best for your particular use case.</p>
<h2 id="api-development-capabilities">API Development Capabilities</h2>
<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are everywhere. They power the backend of almost all major systems out there (according to a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/3307" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study conducted by O’Reilly in 2020</a>, 77% of companies were using microservices/APIs).</p>
<p>That is to say, if you’re thinking about becoming a backend developer, you will be coding APIs/microservices. This is why understanding the basics of them is crucial to ensuring your relevance in the field.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057608824.png" alt="System vs External System"></p>
<p>The above diagram explains how APIs interact with whatever you might be building.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re inside the “<strong>The System</strong>” box, then you need to understand how to interact with these APIs using the right tools. If you’re inside the “<strong>External System</strong>” box, then you need to understand the type of standards these APIs need to follow and how to implement them.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though, for both situations, there are always frameworks and libraries you can use to simplify your task and ensure you’re following the proper industry standards.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-most-common-api-types">What are the most common API types?</h3>
<p>The most common types of APIs used in the industry currently are REST and GraphQL.</p>
<p>As a backend developer, it’s not mandatory that you master both of these types, but it’s definitely recommended that you have some practical experience with one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RESTful APIs.</strong> These are APIs that work over HTTP and make extensive use of the HTTP Verbs to give meaning to each request. They’ve been the most popular type of API until recently, so there are still a lot of projects and teams that make use of it.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL.</strong> GraphQL APIs operate over HTTP as well, leveraging the HTTP protocol and its verbs. In contrast to the conventional RESTful APIs, GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative, offering a flexible and efficient approach to data querying and manipulation. GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, providing a more tailored and efficient interaction between clients and servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there one better than the other? There is no easy way to answer that question as both are capable of doing everything you’d need. It’s more about your particular requirements and the preferences of your dev team.</p>
<h2 id="version-control-savvy">Version Control Savvy</h2>
<p>One mandatory skill that all backend developers should work on (actually, all developers, in general) is version control, or in other words, understanding and being familiar with version control systems.</p>
<p>Essentially, you’ll want to know how to use the version control tool that everyone else is using. The industry standard at the moment of writing this is <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Git</a>, while there might be some teams using other (older) tools, as long as you understand the current one, you’ll be in good shape.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-version-control">What is version control?</h3>
<p>Version control references the ability for you and other developers to share code with each other while you’re working on the same files.</p>
<p>While Git is the industry standard at the moment, GitHub has created such a popular platform around Git, that it almost makes it mandatory to learn about.</p>
<p>So go ahead and create an account, browse what others are doing, and upload your own personal projects. It’s definitely a great way to learn.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-you-learn-about-git">What should you learn about Git?</h3>
<p>If you’re picking up Git as your version control system of choice, there are two main areas you should be focusing on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The basics.</strong> Clearly understanding how Git works and the basic commands to add, push and pull changes. You should aim to learn enough about them to feel comfortable using them on your day-to-day (because you will).</li>
<li><strong>Branching strategies.</strong> Sadly, using Git alone is not enough. While through Git you can already start versioning your code, when the project is complex enough and your team big enough, the tool alone will not be enough. You’ll have to come up with <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=es_ES" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">branching strategies</a> to organize the whole team’s workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that Git and Git branching are not trivial topics, and they’ll take a while to master. So, while you should give yourself time to learn about them, also make sure you check with others (or use tools such as ChatGPT) to validate your commands before using them. Remember, a wrong Git command or a wrong workflow can cause major problems within a project, especially if there are many developers working on the same codebase.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Understanding both what testing is and the importance of it within the backend development workflow is crucial for all developers, and one of the mandatory backend developer skills to focus on.</p>
<p>Testing is the development process of making sure your code works in a way that doesn’t involve you manually testing every feature but rather using tools that allow you to test and reproduce any problems that can be found programmatically.</p>
<p>This, of course, helps to remove potential human error from the equation when testing big systems and to increase the speed at which these tests can be done (think seconds vs hours of you doing it manually).</p>
<p>Testing is a far more complex discipline than I can describe here. Just know that there are many different ways to test a system, and all backend developers should be aware of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit testing:</strong> This is the most common way of doing code testing. You’ll write tests using a testing framework for every publicly available function/method in your code. This way you’re making sure every piece of code that can be used is tested and performs according to plan. Running these tests is usually quite fast, so you’ll be doing it before every commit (usually).</li>
<li><strong>Integration testing:</strong> If you’re building a system that consists of multiple independent systems working together (think, for instance, a microservice-based architecture), then testing each individual part is not enough. You also have to make sure systems that should interact with each other do so correctly. This is where integration tests come into play.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-end testing (E2E):</strong> These tests are similar to integration tests, but they also include the UI of the system. There are tools you can use to automate actions in your UI as if a real user were performing them and then checking the result. For example, clicking on a log-out button and checking if you’re later redirected to the log-in screen. This flow would involve the backend performing some actions that result in the user being logged out.</li>
<li><strong>Load testing:</strong> While not exactly the same process as with the previous test types, load testing is great for backend systems because it helps you determine if your backend is ready to deal with high amounts of traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of the list in graphical format as the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057834295.png" alt="Testing types"></p>
<p>If you’re just getting started with testing, I’d recommend focusing only on unit testing for the time being. Once you have a grasp on it, start moving out following the above diagram and slowly move into the other types as you progress.</p>
<h2 id="cicd-and-devops-familiarity">CI/CD and DevOps Familiarity</h2>
<p>As a backend developer, your code will be constantly deployed, either into cloud environments or perhaps even into normal, on-premise servers. The point is that what you build will run through CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) processes.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058122541.png" alt="ci-cd"></p>
<p>These processes will automatically test it (Continuous Integration) and automatically deploy it (if all tests go well). As a backend developer, you’re not usually expected to know and understand how to configure these processes; however, it’s important that you know about them.</p>
<p>DevOps is yet another tangential area to that of a backend developer. When teams are small enough, backend devs might be “gently pushed” into tasks such as configuring CI/CD pipelines, setting up servers, and more. These tasks are usually performed by dedicated professionals with the role of DevOps. Their specialty is automation, making the deployment process efficient and ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the real-world server environment. They play a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and performance of applications and websites.</p>
<p>So, while they’re not strictly the responsibilities of backend developers, they’re close enough to the role’s day-to-day that it would be a good idea to learn about them. If you’re interested in learning more about DevOps, check out <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">our DevOps roadmap</a> containing all the key topics you should learn about if you want to become a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>
<p>Finally, the last set of backend developer skills you should focus on are, actually, not technical skills, nor are they exclusively useful for backend developers. These are skills that every developer should work on during their career: soft skills.</p>
<h3 id="improving-communication">Improving communication</h3>
<p>The ability to communicate with others, both technical and non-technical people, is crucial in any developer’s career.</p>
<p>For backend developers, it’s especially important because communicating their work and the effects of it is definitely harder than other roles, such as frontend developers who can actually showcase what they’re building.</p>
<p>As a backend developer, you’ll be able to better explain problems or blockers to your colleagues, you’ll be able to perform requirement gathering much more effectively, and you’ll even improve your own problem-solving skills by being better at articulating the problems and potential solutions to yourself.</p>
<h3 id="critical-thinking">Critical thinking</h3>
<p>Honing your critical thinking as a backend developer will help your ability to analyze complex problems, identify patterns much faster, and come up with innovative solutions to the problems you’re facing.</p>
<p>Pushing the limits of your critical thinking skills will also foster a more systematic and strategic approach to coding and architecting robust and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>In other words, it’ll make you a better and more efficient coder. And who doesn’t want that?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, if you expect to become a backend developer or to grow in the area of backend development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye on the industry to understand what’s the status quo and what’s new and hot.</li>
<li>Understand the basics of software design and architecture.</li>
<li>Look into relational databases and NoSQL databases as well; they’re both important.</li>
<li>Learn how to build and use APIs; they’ll be part of almost every project you work on.</li>
<li>Remember, testing might look like it’s not mandatory, but it’s definitely a standard practice when it comes to backend development.</li>
<li>CI/CD and DevOps are practices you’ll be involved with, either directly or indirectly, so learn about them.</li>
<li>Soft skills are just as important as technical skills if you expect to grow in your career.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, do not take this list as the ultimate roadmap but rather as a starting point. If you’re willing to take your backend developer career to the next level, push yourself out of your comfort zone and pursue the skills listed here and the ones listed in this detailed <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, constant learning is the only absolute truth in the software development world (this is true for backend developers, too). If you keep your skillset updated with the latest trends, you’ll remain adaptable and effective as a backend developer.</p>`,cs={title:"8 In-Demand Backend Developer Skills to Master",description:"Learn what the essential backend skills you should master to advance in your career.",authorId:"fernando",excludedBySlug:"/backend/developer-skills",seo:{title:"8 In-Demand Backend Developer Skills to Master",description:"Learn what the essential backend developer skills are that you should learn and master to advance in your career.",ogImageUrl:"https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-developer-skills-ece68.jpg"},relatedTitle:"Other Guides",relatedGuidesId:"backend",isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","textual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},ds="/workspace/src/data/guides/backend-developer-skills.md",hs=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=cs;return e.file=ds,e.url=hs,l`${p()}${r(ps())}`});const us=()=>`<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-development-tools-ou6el.jpg" alt="Must-have backend developer tools to use."></p>
<p>As developers, we’re not just writing code on a text editor without any other external help. Whether we realize it or not, we’re constantly using different development tools to improve the way we work and the speed at which we can deliver our code.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll cover 25 backend development tools that are crucial in the web development industry, and as a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend developer</a>, you should be aware of them.</p>
<p>The categories we’ll tackle are:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDEs and editors</li>
<li>Database tools</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Hosting Services</li>
<li>API-Related tools</li>
<li>Productivity tools</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="beyond-programming-languages-ides-and-editors">Beyond programming languages: IDEs and Editors</h2>
<p>Other than the actual programming languages, the Integrated Development Environment (A.K.A your IDE) is the single most important tool you’ll have to pick and use throughout your career in software development.</p>
<p>Some of them are generic (as in, they work for all types of development), and others will have specific backend development tools (which is what we’re focusing on right now).</p>
<p>Let’s see some examples that are great for a web development project.</p>
<h3 id="1-jetbrains-products">1. Jetbrains Products</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jetbrains family</a> of IDEs targets multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, .NET, JAVA (and the Java Virtual Machine), Python, PHP, and more (mostly great options for web development).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/jetbrains-code-editor-z7z1t.png" alt="Jetbrains code editor"></p>
<p>The benefit of using these IDEs, in comparison with others, is that given how they’re language/technology specific, they have tools designed for those programming languages and specifically for this list to help in your backend development tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debuggers.</li>
<li>Improved IntelliSense.</li>
<li>Improved development environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only minor issue with these IDEs, especially when compared to the rest of the options listed here, is that they’re not all free. While not all of them are priced the same, I recommend you check out your IDE’s pricing page to understand what options you have (there are free plans if you qualify for them).</p>
<h3 id="2-visual-studio-code">2. Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VSCode</a> is definitely one of the most popular alternatives these days for all types of web developers, but definitely for backend developers. This IDE’s strongest selling point is that it’s incredibly extensible through plugins. And the community using it is so big and varied that there are plugins for literally anything you need.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vscode-code-editor-8pznw.png" alt="VSCode code editor"></p>
<p>The other major benefit of VSCode over JetBrains products is that it gives developers a fully working IDE for FREE. While some of the extensions don’t provide exactly the same developer experience as a JetBrains IDE, the proper combination of extensions can provide a very close alternative through VSCode.</p>
<h3 id="3-zed">3. Zed</h3>
<p><a href="https://zed.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Zed</a> is a different type of code editor, and because of that, it might just be the right one for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/zed-code-editor-7ovxz.png" alt="Zed code editor"></p>
<p>Zed, like VSCode, is an all-purpose code editor, letting you code in whatever language you want (whether you’re doing web development or not). The main reasons why you’d pick Zed over others are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved performance.</strong> Zed takes advantage of your CPU AND GPU to improve the speed at which the IDE responds to your commands.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-user support.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team features.</strong> Zed lets you build software while working with others by sharing notes and letting you interact with teammates through the IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zed is an <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">open-source project</a>, but at the time of writing this article, it’s only available for macOS, so Linux and Windows users are still unable to try this excellent option.</p>
<h3 id="4-sublime-text">4. Sublime Text</h3>
<p>Before VSCode, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> was probably one of the most popular code editors for web developers who wanted something powerful for free.</p>
<p>Just like VSCode, Sublime supports extensibility through plugins, and the rich ecosystem of plugins makes it quite a versatile editor. As a note, this code editor also supports GPU rendering of the UI, like Zed does, so if performance is important to you, then you’ll want to keep reading.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sublime-text-code-editor-ngtnf.png" alt="Sublime code editor"></p>
<p>With a refreshed UI (if you’ve used Sublime Text in the past, you’ll be happily surprised!) and better internal tooling, the latest version of this editor (version 4) is trying to regain the portion of the market that VSCode took from it at the time.</p>
<h3 id="5-vim---a-developer-focused-editor">5. VIM - a developer-focused editor</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VIM</a> is a tool that you either hate or love as a developer, but there is no middle ground.</p>
<p>This is such an iconic text editor that all the previously mentioned IDE have what is called a “vim mode,” which allows you to use them as if you were using VIM (with the visual and input modes).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vim-code-editor-ohiyc.png" alt="Vim code editor"></p>
<p>Vim lets you write code without having to move your fingers away from the home row (the row where you “rest” your fingers, the one with the F and G keys). That means you can navigate documents, write code, move through projects, and more, all with minimum hand movement.</p>
<p>This is the key philosophy behind Vim’s design, and if you embrace it, it should help to make you a very proficient developer. Of course, adapting to this way of working is not trivial, and there is a lot of muscle memory that has to be re-trained. But once you do it, it’s really hard to go back.</p>
<p>Just like with all the generic IDEs here, you’ll have to <a href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?order_by=creation_date&#x26;direction=descending" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">customize it through “scripts”</a> to make it work exactly as you want for your environment.</p>
<h2 id="database-tools">Database Tools</h2>
<p>While doing backend development, you will definitely be interacting with databases. They’re a ubiquitous backend tool in the realm of web development.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some great database tools you can use as a backend developer to interact with your favorite database management systems (DBMS).</p>
<h3 id="6-datagrip">6. DataGrip</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Datagrip</a> is a JetBrains product, which makes it a great option if you’re also going with a JetBrains IDE.</p>
<p>This tool lets you access all SQL databases from within the same user interface, it provides great help while browsing the data stored in the database, and it also has features that help you write better SQL queries.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/datagrip-database-explorer-l8987.png" alt="DataGrip database explorer"></p>
<p>While the pricing of these tools might be a bit steep (especially if you go with the IDE as well), it’s definitely a solid option if you’re looking for feature-rich and stable software development tools.</p>
<h3 id="7-navicat">7. Navicat</h3>
<p><a href="https://navicat.com/en/products" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Navicat</a> actually has a family of alternatives based on what you need, from the standard set of SQL databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, Postgre, and so on) up to other NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis.</p>
<p>In general, the Navicat alternatives are quite lightweight and powerful to use. They might not be as feature-rich as Datagrip, but they let you easily browse and query the data you need.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/navicat-database-explorer-r1unn.png" alt="Navicat database explorer"></p>
<p>The free trial for Navicat only lasts 14 days, and then you’ll have to pay a monthly fee. That said, for non-commercial use, the license is quite low, which makes it accessible to almost all developers.</p>
<p>As for features, it has all the ones you’d expect from a tool like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to connect to multiple databases and visually browse their content.</li>
<li>Query editor with some IntelliSense built-in.</li>
<li>Model representation (automatically converts a database into ER Diagrams).</li>
<li>Simple object designer to create entities through a visual IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Navicat series of apps are great backend tools to have at your disposal, if you don’t mind their price, that is.</p>
<h3 id="8-tableplus">8. TablePlus</h3>
<p><a href="https://tableplus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tableplus</a> is very similar to Navicat in the sense that it’s another lightweight database manager. The main differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tableplus only supports SQL-based databases.</li>
<li>The pricing model is simpler, by only charging a one-time license without you having to commit to a monthly subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/tableplus-database-manager-06d09.png" alt="TablePlus database manager"></p>
<p>Some of the most relevant features of Tableplus are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline data editing.</li>
<li>Advanced filtering lets you combine different filtering conditions when searching.</li>
<li>Code auto-complete, which comes in very handy when writing SQL queries.</li>
<li>Extensible through JavaScript plugins (currently in Beta).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a solid backend tool alternative to any of the previous options and with a simpler price tag.</p>
<h3 id="9-dbeaver">9. DBeaver</h3>
<p><a href="https://dbeaver.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DBeaver</a> is a free, cross-platform tool that lets you connect and interact with multiple databases. While there is a PRO version with extra features, the free version is more than powerful enough to get you started with almost any database you can think of, both SQL and NoSQL alike.</p>
<p>For a full list of supported databases on the free version, check out their <a href="https://dbeaver.io/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">about page</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/dbeaver-database-manager-fvlrd.png" alt="DBeaver database manager"></p>
<p>Some of the major features of DBeaver are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL editor with completion.</li>
<li>ER-diagram creation from a table definition.</li>
<li>In-line data editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task management to kill any long-lasting queries that block your database.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-tools-for-web-development">Collaboration tools for web development</h2>
<p>Unless you’re working as a solo-dev (and even then!), collaboration tools allow you to coordinate your work and understand who’s working on what and what you should be working on next.</p>
<p>While these might not be considered “backend tools” per se, they definitely help improve your performance and organization, so we can still call them “development tools” as a broader term.</p>
<h3 id="10-trello">10. Trello</h3>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trello</a> is a very simple yet powerful organizational tool that lets teams build a Kanban-like board with clear states and simple UX (drag&#x26;drop is king in Trello).</p>
<p>Setting up a new project and a team takes minutes in Trello, and through the plugin system, you can get extra features such as date reminders, calendar integrations, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/trello-board-o0i4i.png" alt="Trello board"></p>
<p>The simple UI and intuitive UX make Trello one of the best options out there for collaborative tools as long as the needs of the team are met with simple column-based layouts and minimal information.</p>
<h3 id="11-monday">11. Monday</h3>
<p><a href="https://monday.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Monday</a> is a relatively new online platform for project management and collaboration. I say “new” because some of the other alternatives here have been around for over 5+ years.</p>
<p>Their limited free plan lasts forever, so if you have a small team and limited requirements, this might just be the perfect tool for you. Also, if you actually need to pay, Monday’s plans are accessible, especially when compared to other alternatives.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/monday-project-management-tool-xws17.png" alt="Monday project management tool"></p>
<p>Monday’s fully customizable UI lets you build the collaborative environment you need. This is a huge advantage over others who’ve been around for longer and have a fixed UI that you have to adapt to.</p>
<h3 id="12-basecamp">12. Basecamp</h3>
<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> is a mix between Trello, Monday, and Notion in the sense that it tries to provide developers with the best and most relevant tools from those worlds, leaving out the ones that just create “noise.”</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/basecamp-project-management-tool-2pusd.png" alt="Basecamp project management tool"></p>
<p>Basecamp’s philosophy is to keep things simple and only focus on the features that truly add to collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple card tables like Trello.</li>
<li>Ability to upload and manage documents and files with your team.</li>
<li>Integrated chat.</li>
<li>Message boards to send notifications to everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only “downside” to basecamp, if you will, is that there is no “forever free” plan. Both their plans are paid and have a 30-day free trial, so you can definitely give it a shot and figure out if what they offer is enough for your needs.</p>
<h3 id="13-wrike">13. Wrike</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wrike.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wrike</a> is yet another attempt at making project management and collaboration feel organic and seamless. They have a minimalistic UI and provide you with over 400 integrations to create your own workflows based on your needs and current ecosystem.</p>
<p>They have a free plan that, while feature-limited, it’s perfect for understanding the basic way of using Wrike and how useful it can be to you in your current project.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/wrike-project-management-tool-5g3kl.png" alt="Wrike project management tool"></p>
<p>Their innovative use of AI allows you to create content faster, analyze project and task descriptions, and create subtasks based on it.</p>
<p>Wrike feels efficient and powerful, even for its free plan. Give it a chance if you’re a freelancer or if you have a small team looking for something new and powerful.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-services">Hosting Services</h2>
<p>When it comes to backend development, deploying your code and running it on the cloud will be a common thing; this is a practice known as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). While in some situations, you’ll be dealing with a custom, in-house infrastructure, there are platforms that will make the entire process very lightweight (as in deploying with a couple of clicks).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common alternatives!</p>
<h3 id="14-railway">14. Railway</h3>
<p><a href="https://railway.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Railway.app</a> aims at giving developers all the tools they need at a click’s distance. We’re talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>PR-triggered deployments.</li>
<li>Support for all popular programming languages.</li>
<li>Autoscaling.</li>
<li>Load balancing.</li>
<li>Monitoring.</li>
<li>A great uptime (99.95%)</li>
<li>With more than 200 ready-made templates for you to get going.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/railway-hosting-j8me8.png" alt="Railway hosting"></p>
<p>Railway has no free plan, but their basic one is very accessible. Careful though, they also charge per resource utilization. Lucky for you, they have a <a href="https://railway.app/pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">very handy consumption calculator</a> to avoid surprises at the end of the month!</p>
<h3 id="15-heroku">15. Heroku</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Heroku</a> is another Platform as a Service provider. This one provides the basic services most of them do, such as autoscaling, monitoring, GitHub integration, and more.</p>
<p>The list of supported programming languages is not huge, but the most common ones are definitely covered: Node.js, Ruby, JAVA, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, and even Clojure.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/heroku-hosting-2u6bz.png" alt="Heroku hosting"></p>
<p>Another great selling point for Heroku is that on top of their infrastructure, they also offer a managed Postgre database as a service and a Redis one. In both situations, you’ll have to pay for the services as you use them, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3 id="16-digital-ocean">16. Digital Ocean</h3>
<p>As opposed to platforms such as Heroku, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> is known as an Infrastructure as a Service provider (IaaS). They give you all the servers you need and all the resources (memory, CPU, etc) you want to pay for. However, setting up your deployment process, automating your integration tests, or even having all the required libraries to run your code is up to you.</p>
<p>This is by no means something bad, some teams do prefer to have that freedom over other platforms like Railway and Heroku, where everything’s already managed.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/digital-ocean-hosting-i7a9c.png" alt="Digital Ocean hosting"></p>
<p>Large-scale applications will usually require to have custom infrastructure that managed services can hardly provide. This is where IaaS providers come in.</p>
<p>On top of their basic offering, they do offer managed databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, and others.</p>
<h3 id="17-hetzner">17. Hetzner</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hetzner</a> is yet another IaaS that offers everything you need to get going if you know what to do with it. In other words, they offer all the hardware you might dream of, even in the cloud, but you have to configure it and maintain it.</p>
<p>Their only “managed” offer is for web hosting though, so if you’re looking to host your website or app and you don’t want to have to deal with server maintenance and configuration, then this is a good option for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/hetzner-hosting-oupq8.jpg" alt="Hetzner hosting"></p>
<p>Other than that, their offering is quite standard, although their pricing model might not be. While they do have the standard pricing tiers like the rest of them, they also give you the option to “bid” for used hardware that is no longer needed.</p>
<h3 id="18-vercel">18. Vercel</h3>
<p>If you’re building a NextJS application and you’re looking for a quick way to deploy it, then there is probably no better place than <a href="https://vercel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vercel</a> (the owner of NextJS).</p>
<p>Their platform allows you to link your GitHub account to their systems and deploy your entire application with a single push to the repo.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vercel-hosting-9jvk9.png" alt="Vercel hosting"></p>
<p>And since they’re experts on NextJS, your app will “just work.”</p>
<p>Even their free plan is perfect for quick SaaS prototypes and small applications. On top of this, they offer monitoring, auto-scaling, load balancing, and everything you’d expect from a PaaS provider.</p>
<p>While it’s true they don’t support other technologies or even offer other related services, such as managed databases, there is hardly anyone who can provide a better developer experience when it comes to deploying a NextJS application.</p>
<h3 id="19-render">19. Render</h3>
<p>You can think of <a href="https://render.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Render</a> as if Vercel and Heroku had a love child. Render gives you the amazing developer experience provided by Vercel but the flexibility (or more) from Heroku.</p>
<p>You’re not tied to a single technology; instead, you have all the major runtimes available out of the box. Much higher HTTP timeouts (up to 100 minutes, which is incredible compared to the standard 10 or 30 seconds most providers give you) and tons of other security and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/render-hosting-w4urq.png" alt="Render hosting"></p>
<p>Render also offers managed MySQL and managed Redis instances for you to use, even in their free tier. In the end, unless you’ve been using Heroku for a while and you’re happy with their DX, it might be a good idea to check out Render instead.</p>
<h3 id="20-ovhcloud">20. OVHCloud</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OVHCloud</a> is an all-in-one solution that seems to provide you with everything you need, from “bare metal” (as in infrastructure) to managed hosting for web applications, managed databases (they have many to choose from), and many other services.</p>
<p>However, they do not seem to offer quality-of-life integrations to make your deployment workflow simple and intuitive.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/ovhcloud-hosting-ncfch.png" alt="OVHCloud hosting"></p>
<p>Now, given how they centralize all related services from domain name registration all the way up to analytics, identity management, file storage (CDN), and even one-click install CMS (content management systems, such as WordPress), etc, it might just be a good option for you. That is if you have the expertise in your team to deal with all these options.</p>
<h2 id="api-related-tools">API-Related Tools</h2>
<p>As backend developers, we’ll always be dealing with APIs (Application Programming Interface), either through using the ones created by others or writing our own.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re doing, it’s always good to have some backend tools to help you build and test them faster, so let’s take a look at a few options.</p>
<h3 id="21-swagger">21. Swagger</h3>
<p>Some developers would argue that one of the hardest parts of creating an API is documenting it. Not only because it might sound like a boring task, but explaining what the API endpoint is doing well enough is not trivial.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://swagger.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Swagger</a> comes into play.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/swagger-api-tool-vngxu.png" alt="Swagger API tool"></p>
<p>This tool allows you to create interactive documentation that provides developers with all they need to understand how to use your endpoints, and at the same time, it also gives them the option to test them directly from the generated UI.</p>
<h3 id="22-postman">22. Postman</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman</a> is less of a documentation-only app and has grown over the years to become a testing API tool that every developer and development team should know about. Backend developers are especially benefited from using Postman because of how well it helps organize and manage APIs.</p>
<p>With Postman, you can organize all your company’s APIs, share them with the associated dev teams, and let them use and interact with them without having to write a single line of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/postman-documentation-tool-cl81q.png" alt="Postman documentation tool"></p>
<p>While Swagger is more of a development tool that every backend developer should know about, Postman is the tool that every development team should use to share &#x26; control internal API access and documentation.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>Finally, the last category is about productivity. While some of the products and services mentioned already do provide productivity enhancements, they weren’t there for that. The following list of backend tools is created thinking only about the benefits they can bring to your productivity while working as a backend developer.</p>
<h3 id="23-iterm">23. iTerm</h3>
<p>If you’re a macOS user, then <a href="https://iterm2.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">iTerm</a> is definitely one of the “must haves” you need to look into. As a backend developer, you’ll spend a lot of your day in the terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/iterm-terminal-developer-tool-zze25.png" alt="iTerm terminal developer tool"></p>
<p>iTerm will take that experience to the next level by bringing in features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel panes inside the same window making it easy to multi-task.</li>
<li>Improved auto-complete</li>
<li>In-window search outside of the current program you’re using.</li>
<li>Instant replay lets you review the latest content on the screen before cleaning it.</li>
<li>Paste history, letting you move through the latest pasted content into the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mind you, none of these features are mandatory; you can easily work without them, but they do improve your quality of life as a developer. Hence the reason why iTerm leads this list.</p>
<h3 id="24-zshohmyzsh">24. Zsh/OhMyZsh</h3>
<p>The combination of these two gives your terminal superpowers. <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Zsh</a> is an improved shell that lets you work much faster and more efficiently if you’re spending several hours typing commands in your terminal. For example, you get features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced tab auto-complete</li>
<li>Extensibility</li>
<li>Spelling corrections</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/zsh-shell-ui-6s163.png" alt="Oh my Zsh shell"></p>
<p>As mentioned above, after you have your ZSH installed and set up, you should look into installing oh-my-zsh, which helps with configuring all the customization options you have on this shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>It comes bundled with <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">over 300 plugins</a>, ranging from 1password integrations to the “jump” plugin, which lets you move around the filesystem by moving from mark to mark (you can assign marks to folders).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Plenty of themes</a> out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself spending hours on the terminal, consider installing this combo.</p>
<h3 id="25-raycast">25. Raycast</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.raycast.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Raycast</a> allows you to improve your productivity by giving you a better application launcher. Instead of using the default launcher, you can replace it with Raycast and gain superpowers.</p>
<p>Now, you suddenly have access to hundreds of <a href="https://www.raycast.com/store" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">community-created extensions</a> that allow you to directly interact with chatGPT from the app launcher, use GitHub, interact with VSCode directly, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/raycast-app-launcher-w5rg3.png" alt="Raycast app launcher"></p>
<p>While it is only available for macOS users, Raycast has become a must-have application for backend developers on this platform. In the end, the faster you can reach for your tools, the more productive you become. And a properly configured Raycast can make your web development process feel like a breeze.</p>`,gs={title:"25 Essential Backend Development Tools for @currentYear@",description:"Elevate your development process with these 25 essential backend developer tools.",authorId:"fernando",excludedBySlug:"/backend/developer-tools",seo:{title:"25 Essential Backend Development Tools for @currentYear@",description:"Elevate your coding with backend developer tools that bring efficiency, scalability, and innovation to your projects.

<p>Of course, Next.js is the best one for me, and that works for me alone. You have to consider your own projects and your own context to understand what the best choice for you would be.</p>
<p>Let’s get into the selection and what their strengths and weaknesses are to help you select the right one for you.</p>
<h2 id="top-7-backend-frameworks-in-2025">Top 7 Backend Frameworks in 2025</h2>
<h3 id="nextjs">Next.js</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/logo-nextjs-mbn1n.png" alt="NextJS"></p>
<p>Next.js is a full-stack React framework and one of the most popular backend frameworks in the JavaScript community. Over the years, it has evolved into a robust web development solution that supports static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and even edge computing. Backed by Vercel, it’s now one of the go-to frameworks for modern web development.</p>
<h4 id="1-performance">1. Performance</h4>
<p>Next.js has a wonderful performance thanks to its ability to optimize for both static and dynamic generation. With server-side rendering and support for edge computing, it’s built to handle high-performance requirements. Additionally, automatic code splitting ensures only the necessary parts of the app are loaded, reducing load times.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="2-scalability">2. Scalability</h4>
<p>Next.js is designed to scale easily, from small static websites to large-scale dynamic applications. Its ability to turn backend routes into serverless functions puts it at an unfair advantage over other frameworks. Paired with Vercel’s deployment platform, scaling becomes almost effortless.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="3-flexibility">3. Flexibility</h4>
<p>Next.js is one of the most flexible frameworks out there. It supports a wide range of use cases, from simple static websites to highly complex full-stack applications. With its API routes feature, developers can create powerful backends, making Next.js suitable for both frontend and backend development in a single framework.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="4-community-and-ecosystem">4. Community and Ecosystem</h4>
<p>The Next.js community (just like the JavaScript community in general)  is large and quite active, with an ever-growing number of plugins, integrations, and third-party tools. The framework has solid documentation and an active ecosystem, thanks to its close ties to both the React community and Vercel’s developer support.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="5-learning-curve">5. Learning Curve</h4>
<p>For developers already familiar with React, Next.js provides a relatively smooth learning curve. However, for those new to SSR, SSG or even RSC (React Server Components), there’s a bit of a learning curve as you adapt to these concepts (after all, you’re learning React and backend development at the same time). That said, the framework’s excellent documentation and active community make it easier to grasp.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="6-security">6. Security</h4>
<p>Next.js doesn’t inherently have a wide array of built-in security tools, but it follows secure default practices and can be paired with Vercel’s security optimizations for additional protection. Out of the box, Next.js ensures some level of security against common web threats but will need further configuration depending on the app’s complexity.</p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Rating: 3.5/5</strong></p>
<h4 id="7-future-proofing">7. Future-Proofing</h4>
<p>Backed by Vercel, Next.js has a bright future. Vercel consistently pushes updates, introduces new features, and improves the overall developer experience. Given its adoption and strong support, Next.js is very future-proof, with no signs of slowing down.</p>

<h3 id="sveltekit">SvelteKit</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/logo-sveltekit-9ntqz.png" alt="SvelteKit"></p>
<p>SvelteKit is a full-stack framework built on top of Svelte, a front-end compiler that moves much of the heavy lifting to compile time rather than runtime. SvelteKit was designed to simplify building modern web applications by providing server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and support for client-side routing—all in a performance-optimized package. In other words, it’s an alternative to Next.js.</p>
<h4 id="1-performance-2">1. Performance</h4>

<p>Version control systems help track and maintain a history of code changes made to an application. With a proper version control system, multiple developers can work on a codebase simultaneously. Through version control, they collaborate on a code repository.</p>
<p>A backend engineer is expected to have proficient knowledge of version control. Git is one of the most common version control systems today. There are many code repositories, including Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-of-security-best-practices">Understanding of security best practices</h3>
<p>A backend developer should have a basic understanding of standard security practices and implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to data. Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery. About every large cloud provider has features that provide security measures, including AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory, and Google Cloud Identity.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-and-communication-skills">Collaboration and communication skills</h3>
<p>A backend developer typically collaborates with other engineers, managers, and testers across multiple teams to ensure consistency and improve user experience. During the interview process, you should pay close attention to the candidate’s communication skills because a backend developer should be able to clearly communicate problems and their approach to a solution. Ask the candidate questions that border on collaboration and see how they respond.</p>
<h2 id="additional-skills-that-will-make-a-candidate-stand-out-as-a-backend-developer">Additional skills that will make a candidate stand out as a backend developer</h2>
<p>The role of a backend developer is very competitive. However, there are some skills that a backend developer should possess to make them stand out. Some of these skills include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous learning</li>
<li>Problem-solving skills</li>
<li>Time management skills</li>
<li>DevOps skills</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continuous-learning">Continuous learning</h3>
<p>The field of <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend engineering</a> is continually expanding, so be sure to look out for candidates who enjoy learning. Find out if they stay up to date with the latest technologies and industry trends and how often they try out new things. In addition to acquiring new skills, you should also find out if they are willing to share knowledge and help in team development.</p>
<h3 id="problem-solving-skills">Problem-solving skills</h3>
<p>While it’s essential to use problem-solving tools, intrinsic problem-solving skills are equally important for a backend developer. Your potential hire should have an analytical mindset and be able to break complex problems into smaller chunks that can be solved incrementally.</p>
<h3 id="time-management-skills">Time management skills</h3>
<p>Engineers sometimes have chaotic workloads, which often lead to burnout and affect their performance. During the interview, ask the candidate about their time management practices and how they manage heavy workloads. Effective time management and prioritizing can make a candidate stand out as an engineer and avoid burnout.</p>
<h3 id="devops-skills">DevOps skills</h3>
<p>Knowledge of <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">docker</a> and container orchestration technologies, such as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is another skill that makes a backend developer stand out. A firm understanding of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) setups is a plus. Consider a candidate with this basic DevOps skill for the role.</p>
<h2 id="common-backend-engineer-job-interview-questions">Common backend engineer job interview questions</h2>
<p>This curated list of the common backend developer job interview questions should help your search:</p>
<p><strong>What are the different HTTP methods?</strong>
Here, the candidate should be able to explain the different HTTP methods, which are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</p>
<p><strong>Describe what you understand</strong> <strong>about continuous integration and continuous delivery</strong>
The candidate is expected to explain what CI/CD means in clear terms.</p>
<p><strong>What are databases</strong>**,** <strong>and what are the different types of databases?</strong>
The candidate should know what a database is and what relational and document databases are, along with examples.</p>
<p><strong>What is object</strong>**-**<strong>oriented programming?</strong>
The candidate should be able to explain OOP, a process of designing software around objects.</p>
<p><strong>Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming</strong>
Here, you should look for the candidate’s understanding of sync and async processes. Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, and each task must be completed before the next start. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run independently without waiting for each other to complete. It uses promises or async/await to handle task completion.</p>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of caching in a backend system</strong>**,** <strong>and what caching strategies have you used?</strong>
The candidate should be able to explain what caching means and also the different caching strategies, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-page caching</li>
<li>Data caching</li>
<li>Result caching</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are some common security vulnerabilities in web applications</strong>**,** <strong>and how will you mitigate them?</strong>
The candidate should be able to explain common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and so on. You can mitigate them by performing proper input validation and secure session management.</p>
<h2 id="effective-interview-strategies-and-assessments">Effective interview strategies and assessments</h2>
<p>Evaluating backend engineers requires targeted assessments that reveal technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Here are practical techniques to help you identify qualified candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code review exercises:</strong> Provide a sample code snippet on any backend programming languages with issues or inefficiencies. Ask candidates to identify problems, propose improvements, and explain their reasoning. This exercise tests attention to detail and understanding of best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Live coding tasks:</strong> Use short coding challenges focused on common backend development tasks like database queries or API calls. Live coding reveals how candidates approach problems under pressure and handle real-time debugging.</li>
<li><strong>System design discussions:</strong> Present a simple system design prompt, like designing a scalable file storage system. Listen for clarity in explaining their thought process, handling of trade-offs, and understanding of backend fundamentals.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral questions on past projects:</strong> Ask about specific backend challenges they’ve faced and how they solved them. Look for evidence of adaptability, collaboration, and knowledge depth, such as experiences with database optimization or API integration.</li>
<li><strong>Assess communication skills:</strong> Observe how they explain technical concepts. Strong candidates communicate clearly and adapt explanations for both technical and non-technical audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods offer a well-rounded view of a candidate’s backend development skills and experience.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Web development is typically divided into two main categories: <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend development</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">frontend development</a>. Frontend development focuses on the visible part of the application for end-users, i.e. the part that users interact with, while backend development involves writing code that remains unseen but is essential for the functioning of all applications—the business logic.</p>
<p>Two of the key components when it comes to backend development are the programming language that you are going to code in and the database. In this article, we will be looking into a subset of programming languages that could be used for backend development. We will be discussing the pros and cons of each and the community to help you pick the best programming language for backend development.</p>
<p>Diving straight in, I will cover the top 5 backend programming languages that you should to learn if you’re looking to broaden your horizons in the server-side world.</p>
<h2 id="top-5-backend-languages-to-learn-for-web-development">Top 5 Backend Languages to Learn for Web Development</h2>
<p>The best backend languages to learn in 2025 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Go</li>
</ul>
<p>Why these languages specifically?</p>
<p>They’re some of the most known and used languages in the industry right now (see <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">StackOverflow’s 2023 Developer Survey</a>). That said, keep in mind that these are all great options, and they’re not presented here in any particular order.</p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a> has been around for decades already and while it’s never been the most popular option, it has always managed to stay within the top 5 choices. People love it for being easy to read, straightforward, and able to handle all sorts of tasks, making it a top pick for developers globally. Sure, Python’s got a big name in data processing and machine learning, but let’s not forget its solid impact on web development!.</p>
<p>What makes Python extra appealing, especially for beginners, is the fact that reading and writing it feels very much like English (or at least, as pseudo code). This makes it a top choice for folks just starting out in coding.</p>
<h4 id="beginner-accessibility-and-learning-resources">Beginner Accessibility and Learning Resources</h4>
<p>One of Python’s standout features is its beginner-friendly syntax, making it an ideal language for those new to programming. The emphasis on readability and the absence of complex syntax (for the most part), eases the learning curve, enabling new developers to quickly grasp fundamental concepts.</p>
<p>Python’s community plays a critical role in its accessibility. Abundant learning resources, tutorials, and documentation are readily available, empowering beginners to progress from basic programming principles to advanced backend development seamlessly. Online platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, Real Python, and even Google offer comprehensive courses tailored to all skill levels.</p>
<h4 id="practical-applications-and-popular-frameworks">Practical Applications and Popular Frameworks</h4>
<p>Python’s versatility is evident in its applicability across a spectrum of industries, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and automation. In the context of backend development, Python shines brightly with its two standout <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/frameworks" target="_blank">backend frameworks</a>: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Django</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Flask</a>.</p>
<h5 id="django">Django</h5>
<p>So, let’s talk about Django – it’s like the superhero of web frameworks, at least in the world of Python. This high-level powerhouse is all about that “batteries-included” style, giving you a whole package of tools and features that make development lightning-fast. It follows the <a href="https://www.crio.do/blog/understand-mvc-architecture/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model-View-Controller</a> (MVC) architecture that gives your web applications a solid structure, making them scalable and easy to keep up.</p>
<p>Part of that whole “batteries-included” motto means that it comes with an admin panel, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for smooth data handling, and security features that make sure your project is secured out-of-the-box. All these goodies work together, making Django a top choice for projects, whether they’re a walk in the park or a brain-bending challenge.</p>
<h5 id="flask">Flask</h5>
<p>On the other hand, Flask, a micro-framework, takes a minimalist approach, providing developers with the flexibility to choose components as needed. While Flask may be lighter than Django, it doesn’t compromise on functionality. Its simplicity and modularity make it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects, allowing developers to tailor the framework to meet specific project requirements.</p>
<p>Both Django and Flask underscore Python’s suitability for backend development, offering developers frameworks that cater to diverse project needs while maintaining Python’s hallmark readability and efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-python">Pros and Cons of Python</h4>
<p>As with all other backend languages in this article, Python has some pros and cons you should consider before picking it as your first backend language.</p>
<h5 id="pros">Pros</h5>
<ul>
<li>The syntax is very easy to learn because it’s very much like writing English.</li>
<li>The ecosystem is quite mature and has some nice frameworks that will contain all the tools you need to get started</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cons">Cons</h5>
<ul>
<li>It’s not the most popular backend language, so while the frameworks available are constantly updated, they aren’t necessarily using the latest technology trends.</li>
<li>The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits Python’s performance in multi-threaded applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank">Java</a> has a massive presence and for good reason (according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JetBrain’s survey in 2022, Java was used by 48% of developers</a>).It’s the kind of programming language that’s everywhere – serving up websites, running your favorite apps, and even powering big-scale enterprise systems.</p>
<h4 id="is-it-worth-learning-java">Is it worth learning Java?</h4>
<p>Now, learning Java, (a strongly typed, object oriented programming language (OOP)), is a journey worth taking, but it’s not a walk in the park. It’s a bit like climbing a mountain – you start at the bottom with the basics, and as you ascend, you get into the nitty-gritty of things like object-oriented programming. The process will force you to learn a lot, which is a great thing, by the end you’ll have a lot of understanding of mechanics and concepts around OOP that can be extrapolated into other languages. However, that can also be overwhelming to some developers who just want to learn by building mini-projects. In those situations, the learning curve of Java might be too long (not steep, but long because there is a lot more to cover than with alternatives such as Python or JavaScript).</p>
<p>That said, the community is big and there are tons of resources, from online courses to forums, helping you navigate the Java landscape. And good reason, considering Java has been around for quite a while.</p>
<h4 id="use-cases-and-robust-ecosystem">Use Cases and Robust Ecosystem</h4>
<p>Java’s everywhere. From web development to mobile apps, and even diving into the world of big data, Java’s got its fingerprints all over. And if it’s not the language itself, it’s the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) powering some other language, like Spark.</p>
<p>Java’s the language of choice for many big enterprises given its innate robustness (the first version of the language was released in 1995, it’s had quite a long time to evolve), and its robust ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it a go-to for developers.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-java">Pros and Cons of Java</h4>
<p>For all its power and robustness, there are some negative (and positive) aspects to picking Java as your first backend language.</p>
<h5 id="pros-1">Pros</h5>
<ul>
<li>Java has a mature ecosystem with a varied array of libraries and frameworks for you to try. The community has been working on them and evolving them for years in many cases, so they’re quite ready to develop enterprise-ready solutions.</li>
<li>Java’s multithreading support makes it ideal for some processing-heavy tasks in the backend of big applications.</li>
<li>Java’s heavy focus on object oriented programming makes it a great option for developers who enjoy that paradigm.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cons-1">Cons</h5>
<ul>
<li>Java’s verbose syntax might be a problem for some people. While you can still code without an issue, it all comes down to personal preference. If you like to write less and do more with your code, Java might not be the ideal pick for you. It’s verbosity can increase development time in some situations.</li>
<li>Java applications can have higher memory consumption than others, especially compared to others like PHP. While the reason for this is their entire architecture, the fact remains.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="javascript-nodejs">JavaScript (Node.js)</h3>
<p>With Node.js in the mix, JavaScript becomes a lingua franca in web development. In other words, you can use the same language both for the frontend (client side) and for the backend (server side) of your application.</p>
<p>That said, keep in mind that depending on the framework you’re using, while it might be JavaScript on both sides, the code and logic you use can be considerably different.</p>
<p>Remember that frontend code is often confused with framework code (as in React, Angular, Vue, etc) by some developers, simply because it’s all JavaScript. But don’t be confused, the backend lacks a lot of the extra “juice” added by the browser (like the DOM API and others).</p>
<h4 id="learning-advantages-of-nodejs">Learning Advantages of Node.js</h4>
<p>If you’ve got the basics of JavaScript down, even if your experience has only been on the frontend, diving into Node.js is like leveling up. It lets you use the same language for both frontend and backend, which means less time juggling languages and more time building cool stuff.</p>
<p>The event-driven, non-blocking architecture is one of the main features that make the language so special – it makes your web apps fast and efficient without you having to learn more complex concepts such as multi-threading. Plus, the community is constantly growing and there are tutorials everywhere to guide you through the Node.js universe.</p>
<p>If you were to rank languages based on the amount of content out there to learn them, JavaScript would be one of the first ones (if not the first one) on the list.</p>
<h4 id="key-frameworks-and-development-tools">Key Frameworks and Development Tools</h4>
<p>Now, let’s talk about frameworks. In the case of JavaScript, this topic is so varied that recommending a single option for someone just getting started is really hard.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to go frontend agnostic, or in other words, you don’t care about the technology being used to develop the client side of your app, then a good starting option would be <a href="https://expressjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Express.js</a>. This framework used to be the industry standard. And while that’s no longer the case, it’s still a perfect first choice if you’re looking for something with the required functionality to make your life a lot easier.</p>
<p>Now, if on the other hand, you’re looking to build the frontend and the backend at the same time, then I would recommend going with <a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Next.js</a> if you’re already familiar with React. Or if on the other hand, you prefer Vue.js, then definitely try <a href="https://nuxt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nuxt</a>. Either one of those will help you get the job done with all the bells and whistles you can think of.</p>
<h4 id="does-it-make-sense-to-pick-up-javascript-as-a-backend-language">Does it make sense to pick up JavaScript as a backend language?</h4>
<p>The answer to this question is always going to be “yes”, whether you’re coming from the frontend and you already have JS experience or if you’re picking it up from scratch. In fact, according to <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">StackOverflow’s 2023 survey, JavaScript is the most used language by professionals</a> (with 65.85% of the votes).</p>
<p><img src="/guides/backend-languages/javascript-interest.png" alt="JavaScript Interest"></p>
<p>If you’re coming from the client side, then adopting JS for your backend will let you start working in minutes. You’ll probably spend more time learning the backend-specific concepts than the language itself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re coming from zero, or from other programming languages, JS has some quirks, for sure, but if you go the JS route, you’re already making way for a potential switch into the frontend in the future. Who knows, maybe in a few months you’ll also want to start working on the frontend, and by having picked up JS as your main backend language, you have 90% of the work already cut for you.</p>
<p>There is really no downside to picking JS as your first backend language.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-javascript">Pros and Cons of JavaScript</h4>
<p>While there might not be a downside to picking JS, there is no perfect language out there, so let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons before moving on to the next one.</p>
<h5 id="pros-2">Pros</h5>
<ul>
<li>Going with JavaScript, you’re using the same language on the backend and on the frontend. There is less cognitive load while switching environments if you’re the one coding both sides of the app.</li>
<li>The ecosystem around JavaScript is one of the richest ones you can find. The community is constantly pushing the limits of the language and coming up with new solutions to everyday problems.</li>
<li>The simple syntax allows you to reduce development time because you don’t have to write as much code to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cons-2">Cons</h5>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous programming can be hard for some developers coming from other languages, like Python for example.</li>
<li>The lack of strong types in JavaScript can cause some problems for big codebases.</li>
<li>The single-thread nature of the language makes it really hard to implement CPU-intensive tasks. While there is support for multi-threading, it’s not extensive nor commonly used.</li>
<li>Debugging asynchronous code can be difficult for new developers given the non-linear nature of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
<p>Now, if you’re looking for something very well established in the web development industry, just like Java but with a shorter learning curve, then you’re probably looking for PHP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a note about PHP’s relevancy, while many developers might claim that PHP is a dying tech, according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">W3Techs, over 75% of websites with a backend use PHP</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the glue that holds a ton of websites together, and its longevity in the web development scene is no accident.</p>
<h4 id="ease-of-mastery-and-vast-library-support">Ease of Mastery and Vast Library Support</h4>
<p>If you’re diving into PHP, you wouldn’t be so wrong (no matter what others might tell you). It’s got a gentle learning curve, which means you can start building things pretty quickly. Getting everything set up and working will probably take you 10 minutes, and you’ll be writing your first “hello world” 5 minutes after that.</p>
<p>The vast community support and an ocean of online resources make mastering PHP a breeze. Plus, its library support is like having a toolkit that’s always expanding – you’ll find what you need, whether you’re wrangling databases, handling forms, or making your website dance with dynamic content.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to pick up PHP, look for the LAMP stack, which stands for <strong>L</strong>inux, <strong>A</strong>pache, <strong>M</strong>ySQL, and <strong>P</strong>HP. With that tech stack, you’ll have everything you need to start creating websites in no time.</p>
<h4 id="modern-php-frameworks-and-their-impact">Modern PHP Frameworks and Their Impact</h4>
<p>If we’re talking about PHP frameworks, then we gotta talk about <a href="https://laravel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel</a> and <a href="https://symfony.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Symfony</a>. They are like the rockstars of the modern PHP world.</p>
<p>Laravel comes with a lot of tools and features that help you speed up your development process. On the other side, Symfony has a modular architecture, making it a solid choice for projects of all sizes.</p>
<p>These frameworks showcase how PHP has evolved, staying relevant and powerful in the ever-changing landscape of web development.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-php">Pros and Cons of PHP</h4>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common advantages of going with PHP for the backend and some cons to discuss why it might not be the best choice for you.</p>
<h5 id="pros-3">Pros</h5>
<ul>
<li>PHP is designed for web development, which still makes it a very popular choice for a backend language.</li>
<li>PHP’s community is quite big, considering how old the language is, so if you need help, chances are, someone has the answer you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cons-3">Cons</h5>
<ul>
<li>One of the major complaints developers have about the language is its inconsistent function naming convention. While not a huge problem, it makes it very hard for developers to intuitively find the right function by name. This causes you to constantly verify your code against the documentation to make sure you’re not making mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="go">Go</h3>
<p>Now, let’s close in on Go, the programming language born at Google that’s all about simplicity and efficiency. Go embraces a clean and straightforward syntax. Despite its simplicity, it focuses heavily on performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern, scalable applications.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PYPL index</a> (using Google searches to weigh interest of developers in a particular language), we can see a clear worldwide growing interest in Go from the development community:</p>
<p><img src="/guides/backend-languages/pypl-go-index.png" alt="Go Interest"></p>
<h4 id="concurrency-and-scalability">Concurrency and Scalability</h4>
<p>Go stands out in the crowd, especially when it comes to handling concurrency and scalability. Its built-in support for concurrent programming, through goroutines and channels, makes it a standout choice for applications that need to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. This makes Go particularly adept at handling the demands of today’s highly concurrent and distributed systems. In other words, Go is a great choice for building microservices, a type of system that is very commonly used as the backend for complex web applications.</p>
<p>So yes, very relevant.</p>
<h4 id="learning-curve-and-developer-productivity">Learning Curve and Developer Productivity</h4>
<p>Learning Go is a smooth ride, thanks to its simplicity and extensive documentation. Developers often find themselves quickly transitioning from understanding the basics to building robust applications.</p>
<p>The language’s focus on developer productivity is evident in its quick compilation times and the absence of excessive boilerplate code, allowing developers to concentrate on building features rather than wrestling with the language itself.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-go">Pros and Cons of Go</h4>
<p>Let’s take a look at some pros and cons for the last programming language on our list.</p>
<h5 id="pros-4">Pros</h5>
<ul>
<li>Go code compiles quickly, which in turn leads to very fast development cycles. This is a big plus if you’re developing a big application with a large codebase because other options might slow down your process with their compilation times.</li>
<li>Go’s syntax is simple enough to make it easy to learn and understand for new developers.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cons-4">Cons</h5>
<ul>
<li>Go’s ecosystem is quite young when compared to the other alternatives here, so the maturity of the tools available might not be the same as, for example, Java or JavaScript tooling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-the-ideal-backend-language">Choosing the Ideal Backend Language</h2>
<p>So, are these the best backend programming languages out there? Is there an absolute “best” backend programming language?</p>
<p>As you’ve probably seen by now, there is no “perfect” or “ideal” backend language. When it comes to picking one out of the huge number of alternatives, you have to consider other aspects outside of the language itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the size of your project? Are you building a large-scale platform? Or just a basic static website?</li>
<li>Do you mind spending more time learning or do you need to be efficient and start coding right away?</li>
<li>Do you already have some programming knowledge and would like to pick something that resembles what you already know? Or would you like to pick up something that’s entirely different?</li>
<li>Are you alone? Or are you part of a team?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve answered those questions, you’ll probably have some idea of where to go, but then you should look into the language itself, specifically into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have enough learning resources for you?</li>
<li>How big and active is the community around it?</li>
<li>Are the main frameworks still under development? Or have they been parked for a while?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, you’re evaluating the language and its ecosystem, making sure they’re both evolving right along the web industry. If you find that there are aspects that are falling behind, then it probably isn’t a good choice.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center">Small section of the full backend roadmap available on <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend">roadmap.sh</a></p>
<p>There you’ll find community-maintained roadmaps for many career paths within software development. In particular, for this article, the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend roadmap</a> is a great place to start, because while picking a backend language is important, you’ll see there that it’s not just about the language. In fact, there is a lot of tech around the language that is also required (I’m referring to databases, git, understanding how client-server communication works, and a big “etc).</p>
<h2 id="what-are-backend-languages">What are backend languages?</h2>
<p>When it comes to web development, there is a very clear distinction between frontend and backend technologies.</p>
<p>While the frontend ecosystem is quite limited to JavaScript (and other JavaScript-based languages, like TypeScript) due to Browser compatibility, the backend (A.K.A server-side) is a very different scenario.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/backend-languages/back-vs-front.png" alt="Backend Languages"></p>
<p>Please note that neither of those lists is extensive, as they’re both constantly growing.</p>
<p>You can think of a backend language as one that “runs on the server side”. That said, by that definition, any language is a backend language because even JavaScript nowadays can be used on the backend as well (thanks to Node, Bun, and Deno).</p>
<p>However, we can go one step further and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A backend language is a server side programming language that has the tools and frameworks required to build web backends”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will narrow down the list a little bit. But essentially, we can think of backend languages as anything that fits the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is able to listen for incoming HTTP/S connections.</li>
<li>Can access databases.</li>
<li>Can send HTTP/S requests.</li>
<li>Can access the filesystem.</li>
<li>Has a rich ecosystem of tools and frameworks to build web applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those features and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, a language can definitely be considered “backend-ready”.</p>
<h2 id="why-learn-a-backend-programming-language">Why learn a backend programming language?</h2>
<p>If you’re already a backend developer, then the main reason would be to become a more versatile developer. The more languages you know, the better code you’ll write. Either because you’ve learned different ways of solving the same problem, or simply because you’ll be able to contribute to more projects.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you’re just getting started, the main reason would be that you’re entering an industry that’s always looking for people.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-market-in-demand-for-backend-developers">Is the market in demand for backend developers?</h2>
<p>One thing to keep in mind right now is that the software development market is always in demand for devs. For example, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics gives our industry a 25% growth rate</a> (demand-wise) from 2022 to 2023, whereas the mean for other industries is 3%.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JetBrains, during 2022, 75% of developers were involved with web development</a> in one fashion or another, so whether you’re backend devs or frontend devs, there is always someone looking for you.</p>
<p>That said, we also have to consider that this industry is becoming a global industry. While some countries might still be fighting that process back, most developers can directly access the global market and work for any company in the world.</p>
<p>That is a great opportunity for a backend developer who lives in an area where there isn’t a big IT industry; however, it also means competing with every other developer in the world. That might cause the illusion that the IT industry is in recession or that there are no job opportunities for developers.</p>
<p>There are always opportunities; it’s just that you’re now after the same job that many others from around the world are after as well.</p>
<p>That said, backend devs are always in high demand because they’re the bread and butter of any web application. They’re always required to create the underlying platform that will power most systems, so the key to standing out here is to stay up-to-date with the industry’s trends and technologies.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. You can’t possibly be expected to keep up with every single programming language that is released or with all the new frameworks that are created every month. However, keeping an eye on the industry and understanding what survives long enough to become a new industry standard is important. You have to keep updating yourself and learning new technologies/skills constantly; that way, you’ll stay relevant.</p>
<h2 id="is-learning-a-backend-language-good-for-your-career">Is learning a backend language good for your career?</h2>
<p>Whether you’re a frontend developer looking to become full-stack (someone who can code both the backend and the frontend of an application), or if you’re new to the industry and you’re thinking if this might be the best place for you, the answer is “yes”.</p>
<p>Backend developers are always in demand, so adding a new tool to your already existing toolbelt (if you’re already a dev) will only make you more flexible in the eyes of your employer.</p>
<p>But remember, a language is just a language until you give it context. If you’re wondering whether or not one of the backend languages in this article might be for you, the answer will always be “yes”. However, understand that if backend development is new to you, you will also need to pick up other skills and backend technologies around the language, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding HTTP.</li>
<li>Learning Structured Query Language (SQL) to query your databases.</li>
<li>Understanding how APIs work.</li>
<li>What server side rendering means and how to take advantage of it.</li>
<li>What web servers are and how to use them/build them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, you’ll understand the language, but you won’t know how to use it for the role of backend development.</p>
<h2 id="jumpstarting-your-backend-development-journey">Jumpstarting Your Backend Development Journey</h2>
<p>To get started with your backend development journey, it’s crucial to have a roadmap that guides you through the learning process and equips you with the skills to build robust and scalable backend systems.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, if you’re reading this, that means you’ve found the most complete and comprehensive roadmap online: <a href="https://roadmap.sh" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>, the current <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend roadmap</a> is filled with details of everything you should and could (optionally) learn in your journey to becoming a backend developer.</p>
<h2 id="guided-learning-from-online-courses-to-bootcamps">Guided Learning: From Online Courses to Bootcamps</h2>
<p>Online courses and bootcamps serve as invaluable companions on your learning expedition. Platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and freeCodeCamp offer comprehensive backend development courses.</p>
<p>These resources not only cover programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript but also dive deep into frameworks like Django, Express.js, or Laravel. For those seeking a more immersive experience, coding bootcamps provide intensive, hands-on training to fast-track your backend development skills.</p>
<p>Whatever choice you go for, make sure you’re not following trends or just copying the learning methods of others. Learning is a very personal experience and what works for others might not work for you, and vice versa. So make sure to do the proper research and figure out what option works best for you.</p>
<h2 id="building-community-connections-for-learning-support">Building Community Connections for Learning Support</h2>
<p>Joining developer communities (there are several on Twitter for example), forums like Stack Overflow, or participating in social media groups dedicated to backend development creates a network of support.</p>
<p>Engaging with experienced developers, sharing challenges, and seeking advice fosters a collaborative learning environment. Attend local meetups or virtual events if you can to connect with professionals in the field, gaining insights and building relationships that can prove invaluable throughout your journey.</p>
<h2 id="think-about-you-and-your-project">Think about you and your project</h2>
<p>There are many ways to go about picking the ideal backend language for you. If there is anything you should take home with you after reading this article, it is that most languages are equivalent in the sense that you’ll be able to do pretty much everything with any of them.</p>
<p>So what criteria can you use to pick the “right one” for you?</p>
<p>The questions you should also be asking yourself are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s your preference for a language? Do you like Object Oriented Programming (OOP) or are you more of a functional programming type of dev? Do you like statically typed programming languages or loosely typed ones? Personal preferences should also play an important role at the time of picking your ideal programming language.</li>
<li>What does my project need? After all, project requirements sometimes dictate technology. Keep that in mind, check if the project’s needs and your personal preferences align, and try to weigh in pros and cons if they don’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, personal preference and actual project requirements (if you have any) are very important, because both will influence how much you enjoy (or don’t enjoy) the learning process.</p>
<h2 id="crafting-a-portfolio-to-display-your-backend-skills">Crafting a Portfolio to Display Your Backend Skills:</h2>
<p>As you accumulate skills and knowledge, showcase your journey through a well-crafted portfolio. Include projects that highlight your backend skills, demonstrating your ability to - design databases, implement server-side logic, and integrate with client side technologies. Whether it’s a dynamic web application, a RESTful API, or a data-driven project, your portfolio becomes a tangible representation of your backend development capabilities for potential employers or collaborators.</p>
<p>When it comes to deciding where to publish this portfolio, you have some options, such as directly on your GitHub profile (if you have one), or perhaps on your own personal website where you can share some design thoughts about each project along with the code.</p>
<p>In the end, the important thing is that you should be sharing your experience somewhere, especially when you don’t have working experience in the field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, there are many backend programming languages to choose from, and what language you go for, is up to you and your particular context/needs. All I can do is guide you to the door, but you have to cross it yourself. Some interesting options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python with its English-like syntax.</li>
<li>Java with its formal syntax and enterprise support.</li>
<li>JavaScript with its flexibility and ability to jump between frontend and backend.</li>
<li>PHP with its proven record of success.</li>
<li>And Go, with its performance and scalability focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re the one who gets to decide, but just know that no matter what you choose, getting started in backend development is a one-way street. You’ll be learning from this moment on, and you’ll be jumping from one language to the other as the field evolves.</p>
<p>Remember that there is a very detailed version of a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend roadmap here</a>, it might be a great place to get started! And if you’re also interested in frontend development, there is an <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">equally handy roadmap</a> here as well!</p>`,xs={title:"The 5 Best Backend Development Languages to Master (@currentYear@)",description:"Discover the best backend development languages to master in @currentYear@.",authorId:"fernando",excludedBySlug:"/backend/languages",seo:{title:"The 5 Best Backend Development Languages to Master (@currentYear@)",description:"Discover the best backend development languages to learn right now for career development, with practical tips from an experienced developer.",ogImageUrl:"https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-languages-2x930.jpg"},relatedTitle:"Other Guides",relatedGuidesId:"backend",isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2024-01-18T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","textual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},Ds="/workspace/src/data/guides/backend-languages.md",Ts=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=xs;return e.file=Ds,e.url=Ts,l`${p()}${r(As())}`});const Is=()=>`<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-project-ideas-zxutw.jpg" alt="Fresh ideas for backend projects."></p>
<p>As backend developers, showcasing our work to others is not straightforward, given that what we do is not very visible.</p>
<p>That said, having a project portfolio, even as backend developers, it’s very important, as it can lead to new job opportunities.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the experience you get out of the entire process of building the apps for your portfolio will help you improve your coding skills.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at 20 of the best backend projects you can work on to improve both your project portfolio and to learn <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend development</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these project ideas are organized from easiest to hardest to complete, and the entire list should take you at least a year to complete, if you’re not rushing the process.</p>
<p>So sit back, grab a cup of your favorite hot drink, and let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="1-personal-blogging-platform-api">1. Personal Blogging Platform API</h2>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Easy</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: CRUD for main operations, databases (SQL or NoSQL), server-side RESTful API.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/blogging-platform-api.png" alt="Blogging Platform API"></p>
<p>Let’s start with a very common one when it comes to backend projects.</p>
<p>This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. This implies that you’d have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.</li>
<li>Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.</li>
<li>Create a new article to be published.</li>
<li>Delete a single article, specified by the ID.</li>
<li>Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>And with those endpoints you’ve covered the basic CRUD operations (<strong>C</strong>reate, <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>U</strong>pdate and <strong>D</strong>elete).</p>
<p>As a recommendation for techstack, you could use <a href="https://fastify.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fastify</a> as the main <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/frameworks" target="_blank">backend framework</a> if you’re going with Node, or perhaps <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Django</a> for Python or even <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href="https://sinatrarb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> for Ruby. As for your database, you could use <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> if you want to try NoSQL or <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySQL</a> if you’re looking to get started with relational databases first.</p>
<h2 id="2-to-do-list-api">2. To-Do List API</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Easy</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: REST API design, JSON, basic authentication middleware.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/todo-list-api-bsrdd.png" alt="To-Do List API"></p>
<p>We’re continuing with the APIs for our backend project ideas, this time around for a To-Do application. Why is it different from the previous one?</p>
<p>While the previous project only focused on the main CRUD operations, here we’ll add some more interesting responsibilities, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>An authentication logic, which means you’ll have to keep a new table of users and their credentials</li>
<li>You’ll have to create both users and tasks.</li>
<li>You’ll also have to be able to update tasks (their status) and even delete them.</li>
<li>Get a list of tasks, filter them by status and get the details of each one.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re free to implement this with whatever programming language and framework you want, however, you could continue using the same stack from the previous project.</p>
<h2 id="3-weather-api-wrapper-service">3. Weather API Wrapper Service</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Easy</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Third-party API integration, caching strategy, environment variable management.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/weather-api-f8i1q.png" alt="Weather API Wrapper Service"></p>
<p>Let’s take our API magic to the next level with this new backend project. Now instead of just relying on a database, we’re going to tackle two new topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using external services.</li>
<li>Adding caching through the use of a quick in-memory storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the actual weather API to use, you can use your favorite one, as a suggestion, here is a link to <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Visual Crossing’s API</a>, it’s completely FREE and easy to use.</p>
<p>Regarding the in-memory cache, a pretty common recommendation is to use <a href="https://redis.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Redis</a>, you can read more about it <a href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, and as a recommendation, you could use the city code entered by the user as the key, and save there the result from calling the API.</p>
<p>At the same time, when you “set” the value in the cache, you can also give it an expiration time in seconds (using the EX flag on the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/set/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SET command</a>). That way the cache (the keys) will automatically clean itself when the data is old enough (for example, giving it a 12-hours expiration time).</p>
<h2 id="4-expense-tracker-api">4. Expense Tracker API</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Easy</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Data modeling, user authentication (JWT).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/expense-tracker-api-m72p5.png" alt="Expense Tracker API"></p>
<p>For the last of our “easy” backend projects, let’s cover one more API, an expense tracker API. This API should let you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up as a new user.</li>
<li>Generate and validate JWTs for handling authentication and user session.</li>
<li>List and filter your past expenses. You can add the following filters:
<ul>
<li>Past week.</li>
<li>Last month.</li>
<li>Last 3 months.</li>
<li>Custom (to specify a start and end date of your choosing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add new expenses.</li>
<li>Remove existing expenses.</li>
<li>Update existing expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s now add some constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be using <a href="https://itnext.io/demystifying-jwt-a-guide-for-front-end-developers-ead6574531c3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JWT</a> (JSON Web Token) to protect the endpoints and to identify the requester.</li>
<li>For the different expense categories, you can use the following list (feel free to decide how to implement this as part of your data model):
<ul>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>Leisure</li>
<li>Electronics</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
<li>Clothing</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a recommendation, you can use MongoDB or an ORM for this project, such as <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mongoose</a> (if you’re using JavaScript/Node for this).</p>
<p>From everything you’ve done so far, you should feel pretty confident next time you have to build a new API.</p>
<h2 id="5-markdown-note-taking-app">5. Markdown Note-taking App</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Text processing, Markdown libraries, persistent storage, REST API with file upload.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/markdown-note-taking-app-tymi3.png" alt="Markdown Note-taking App"></p>
<p>You’ve been building APIs all this time, so that concept alone should not be a problem by now. However, we’re increasing the difficulty by allowing file uploads through your RESTful API. You’ll need to understand how that part works inside a RESTful environment and then figure out a strategy to store those files while avoiding name collisions.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to process the text in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll provide an endpoint to check the grammar of the note.</li>
<li>You’ll also provide an endpoint to save the note that can be passed in as Markdown text.</li>
<li>Return the HTML version of the Markdown note (rendered note) through another endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a recommendation, if you’re using JavaScript for this particular project, you could use a library such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Multer</a>, which is a Node.js module.</p>
<h2 id="6-url-shortening-service">6. URL Shortening Service</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Database indexing, HTTP redirects, RESTful endpoints</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/url-shortening-service-c1nzi.png" alt="URL Shortening Service"></p>
<p>We’re now moving away from your standard APIs, and tackling URL shortening. This is a very common service, which allows you to shorten very long URLs, especially when looking to share them on social media or make them easily memorable.</p>
<p>For this project idea let’s focus on the following features, which you should be more than capable of implementing on your local environment, no matter your OS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to pass a long URL as part of the request and get a shorter version of it. You’re free to decide how you’ll perform the shortening .</li>
<li>Save the shorter and longer versions of the URL in the database to be used later during redirection.</li>
<li>Configure a catch-all route on your service that gets all the traffic (no matter the URI used), finds the correct longer version and performs a redirection so the user is seamlessly redirected to the proper destination.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-real-time-polling-app">7. Real-time Polling App</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: WebSockets, live data updates, state management</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/realtime-polling-app-8qx5h.png" alt="Real-time Polling App"></p>
<p>Time to leave APIs alone for a while and focus on real-time interactions, another hot topic in web development. In fact, let’s try to use some sockets.</p>
<p>Sockets are a fantastic way of enabling 2-way communication between two or more parties (systems) with very few lines of code. Read more about sockets <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-sockets" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, we’re building both a client and a server for this project. The client can easily be a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool or a terminal program that will connect to the server and show the information being returned in real-time.</p>
<p>The flow for this first socket-based project is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client connects to the server and sends a pre-defined request.</li>
<li>The server upon receiving this request, will send, through the same channel, an automatic response.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the flow might seem very similar to how HTTP-based communication works, the implementation is going to be very different. Keep in mind that from the client perspective, the request is sent, and there is no waiting logic, instead, the client will have code that gets triggered when the message from the server is received.</p>
<p>This is a great first step towards building more complex socket-based systems.</p>
<h2 id="8-simple-e-commerce-api">8. Simple E-commerce API</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Shopping cart logic, payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal), product inventory management</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/simple-ecommerce-api-thzqo.png" alt="Simple E-commerce API"></p>
<p>Back to the world of APIs, this time around we’re pushing for a logic-heavy implementation.</p>
<p>For this one, you’ll have to keep in mind everything we’ve been covering so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>JWT authentication to ensure many users can interact with it.</li>
<li>Interaction with external services. Here you’ll be integrating with payment gateways such as Stripe.</li>
<li>A complex data model that can handle products, shopping carts, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at the responsibilities of this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>JWT creation and validation to handle authorization.</li>
<li>Ability to create new users.</li>
<li>Shopping cart management, which involves payment gateway integration as well.</li>
<li>Product listings.</li>
<li>Ability to create and edit products in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project might not seem like it has a lot of features, but it compensates in complexity, so don’t skip it, as it acts as a great progress check since it’s re-using almost every skill you’ve picked up so far.</p>
<h2 id="9-fitness-workout-tracker">9. Fitness Workout Tracker</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: User-specific data storage, CRUD for workout sessions, date-time manipulation.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/fitness-workout-tracker-82uux.png" alt="Fitness Workout Tracker"></p>
<p>This backend project is not just about taking in user-generated notes, but rather, about letting users create their own workout schedules with their own exercises and then go through them, checking the ones they’ve done, and the ones they haven’t.</p>
<p>Making sure you also give them the space to add custom notes, with remarks about how the exercise in question felt and if they want to tweak it in the future.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the following responsibilities for this backend project:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be a user sign-up and log-in flow in this backend system, as many users should be able to use it.</li>
<li>There needs to be a secure JWT flow for authentication.</li>
<li>The system should let users create workouts composed of multiple exercises.</li>
<li>For each workout, the user will be able to update it and provide comments on it.</li>
<li>The schedule the user creates needs to be associated to a specific date, and any listing of active or pending workouts needs to also be sorted by date (and time if you want to take it one step further).</li>
<li>There should also be a report of past workouts, showing the percentage of finished workouts during the queried period.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data model for this one can also be complex, as you’ll have predefined exercises that need to be grouped into workout sessions, and those can then have associated comments (input from the user).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/fitness-workout-tracker-datamodel-5mrkq.png" alt="Fitness Workout Tracker Data Model"></p>
<p>Consider the benefits of using a structured model here vs something document-based, such as MongoDB and pick the one that feels better for your implementation.</p>
<h2 id="10-recipe-sharing-platform">10. Recipe Sharing Platform</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Moderate</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: File uploads and image processing (like Sharp), user permissions, complex querying</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/recipe-sharing-platform-jzs08.png" alt="Recipe Sharing Platform"></p>
<p>While this project might feel a lot like the first one, the personal blogging platform, we’re taking the same concept, and then adding a lot more on top of it.</p>
<p>We’re building a RESTful API (or rather several) that will let you perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access a list of recipes. You should be able to filter by keywords (text input), publication date, by chef, and by labels. Access to this endpoint should be public.</li>
<li>The list should be paginated, and as part of the response on every page.</li>
<li>Users should be able to sign up as chefs to the system to upload their own recipes.</li>
<li>A JWT-secured login flow must be present to protect the endpoints in charge of creating new recipe posts.</li>
<li>Images uploaded as part of the recipe should be processed to be re-sized into a standard size (you pick the dimensions). You can use a library such as <a href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sharp</a> for this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11-movie-reservation-system">11. Movie Reservation System</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Relational data modeling (SQL), seat reservation logic, transaction management, schedule management.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/movie-reservation-system-5823e.png" alt="Movie Reservation System"></p>
<p>There are very expensive pre-made tools that handle all this logic for companies, and the following diagram shows you a glimpse of that complexity.</p>
<p>As backend projects go, this one is a great example of the many different problems you might need to solve while working in web development.</p>
<p>A movie reservation system should allow any user to get tickets and their associated seats for any movie playing the specific day the user is looking to attend. This description alone already provides a lot of features and constraints we have to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re going to have a list of movies (and maybe theaters as well).</li>
<li>Each movie will have a recurring schedule for some time and then it’ll be taken out to never return.</li>
<li>Users should be able to list movies, search for them and filter by dates, genres and even actors.</li>
<li>Once found, the user should be able to pick the seats for their particular movie of choice, and for their date of choice.</li>
<li>This leads us to you having to keep a virtual representation of your movie theater to understand seating distribution and availability.</li>
<li>In the end, the user should also be able to pay using an external payment gateway such as Stripe (we’ve already covered this step in the past).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="12-restaurant-review-platform-api-with-automatic-nlp-analysis">12. Restaurant Review Platform (API) with automatic NLP analysis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: RESTful API, In-memory database (for live leaderboard), SQL, Natural Language Processing to auto-label positive and negative comments.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/restaurant-review-platform-26c1f.png" alt="Restaurant Review Platform"></p>
<p>Now this project takes a turn into the land of noSQL and AI by leading with user input. The aim of this particular backend project is to provide a very simple API that will let users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input their own review of a restaurant (ideally, the API should request the restaurant’s ID to make sure users are reviewing the correct one).</li>
<li>Keep a leaderboard of restaurants with a generic positive or negative score, based on the type of reviews these restaurants get. For this, you can use Redis as an in-memory leaderboard to have your API query it, instead of hitting the database you’re using. This also implies that you’ll have to keep the leaderboard updated on Redis as well (as a hint: look for type <a href="https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SortedSet</a> data type to understand how to do this).</li>
<li>Perform NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the user’s text portion of the review, to understand if it’s a positive one or a negative one.</li>
<li>Use the result of the NLP as a scoring system for the leaderboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a recommendation, you might want to use Python on this project, as there tend to be more libraries around NLP for this language.</p>
<h2 id="13-multiplayer-battleship-game-server">13. Multiplayer Battleship Game Server</h2>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Game state synchronization, low-latency networking, concurrency control.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/multiplayer-battleship-lv5oj.png" alt="Multiplayer Battleship Game Server"></p>
<p>For this project you’re not going to build a full game from scratch, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>You will however, build a game server. Your game server will have to maintain the internal state of each player’s board, and it should also enable communication between them by broadcasting their actions and results. Since we have “low-latency networking” as a constraint here, the logical implementation would be through the use of Sockets (so if you haven’t done it yet, go back to project 7 and work on it first).</p>
<p>You’re free to pick the programming language you feel more comfortable with, however, keep the mind that you’ll have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of the player’s state and game state.</li>
<li>Enable 2-way communication between players and server.</li>
<li>Allow players to join the game and set up their initial state somehow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be a very fun project to work on, even if you’re “just” building a terminal version of this multiplayer game, as you’ll be using several of the concepts and technologies covered so far on this list.</p>
<h2 id="14-database-backup-cli-utility">14. Database Backup CLI utility</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Advanced SQL, Database fundamentals, CLI development, Node.js (for CLI)</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/database-backup-cli-jwrcj.png" alt="Database Backup CLI utility"></p>
<p>We’re now moving away from the API world for a while, and into the world of command line interfaces, which is another very common space for backend developers to work on.</p>
<p>This time around, the project is a CLI utility to back up an entire database.</p>
<p>So for this project, you’ll be creating a command line utility that takes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> the host of your database (it can be localhost or anything else).</li>
<li><strong>Username</strong>: the utility will need a username to login and query the database.</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong>: same with the password, usually databases are protected this way.</li>
<li><strong>DB Name</strong>: the name of the database to backup. We’re backing up the entire set of tables inside this database.</li>
<li><strong>Destination folder</strong>: the folder where all the dump files will be stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that information, your utility should be able to connect to the database, pull the list of tables, and for each one understand its structure and its data. In the end, the resulting files inside the destination folder should have everything you need to restore the database on another server simply by using these files.</p>
<p>Finally, if you haven’t heard of it yet, you might want to check out the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/show-create-table.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SHOW CREATE TABLE</a> statement.</p>
<h2 id="15-online-code-compiler-api">15. Online Code Compiler API</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Sandboxing code execution, integration with compilers, WebSocket communication.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/online-code-compiler-c7xjb.png" alt="Online Code Compiler API"></p>
<p>For this project, you’ll be building the backend of a remote code execution application. In other words, your APIs will allow you to receive source code written using a specific language of choice (you can pick the one you want, and only allow that one), run it and then return the output of that execution.</p>
<p>Of course, doing this without any restrictions is not worth it for being in the “difficult” section of this list, so let’s kick it up a notch:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code execution should be done inside a safe sandbox, which means that the code can’t hurt or affect the system it’s running on, no matter what the code or the logic dictates.</li>
<li>On top of that, for long-running tasks, the API should also provide a status report containing the following information:</li>
<li>Time running.</li>
<li>Start time of the execution.</li>
<li>Lines of code being executed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="16-messaging-platform-backend">16. Messaging Platform Backend</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Real-time messaging, end-to-end encryption, contact synchronization</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/messaging-platform-backend-96jpw.png" alt="Messaging Platform Backend"></p>
<p>Yes, we’re talking about a chat platform here. And as a backend developer you’re more than ready to implement both the server and the client application.</p>
<p>This backend project would take project #7 to the next level, by implementing the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding message encryption between client applications</li>
<li>The ability to understand who’s online</li>
<li>Understand if those users are interacting with you (a.k.a showing the “[username] is typing” message in real-time).</li>
<li>Sending a message from one of the clients into the server should be broadcasted to the rest of the clients connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a recommendation for technology implementing this project, <a href="http://socket.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> would be a perfect match. This means you’d be using JavaScript (node.js) for this.</p>
<h2 id="17-content-delivery-network-cdn-simulator">17. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Simulator</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Very Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Load balancing algorithms, caching strategies, network latency simulation</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cdn-simulator-lv7kl.png" alt="Content Delivery Network (CDN) Simulator"></p>
<p>For this particular backend project, we’re not going to focus on coding, but rather on backend tools and their configuration. A <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cdn/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CDN</a> (or Content Delivery Network) is a platform that allows you to serve static content (like text files, images, audio, etc) safely and reliably.</p>
<p>Instead of having all files inside the same server, the content is replicated and distributed across a network of servers that can provide you with the files at any given point in time.</p>
<p>The point of this project is for you to figure out a way to set up your own CDN keeping in mind the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use cloud servers (you can pick your favorite cloud provider for this)</li>
<li>Configure a load balancer to distribute the load between all servers.</li>
<li>Set up a caching strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that all major cloud providers have a free tier that allows you to use all their services for some time. AWS for example, allows for a full year of free tier limited to the type of resources you can use.</p>
<h2 id="18-time-tracking-cli-for-freelancers">18. Time-tracking CLI for Freelancers</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Very Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: time tracking, interactive CLI, Day.js for time operations, reporting.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/time-tracking-cli-freelancers-x7ldv.png" alt="Time-tracking CLI for Freelancers"></p>
<p>As freelancers, sometimes understanding what you’re working on, or understanding how much time you’ve spent on a particular project once it’s time to get paid, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>So, with this command line interface tool, we’ll try to solve that pain for freelancers. The tool you’re developing should let you specify that you’re starting to work on a project, and once you’re done, you should also be able to say that you’ve stopped.</p>
<p>On top of that, there should be an interactive reporting mode that should tell you the amount of time spent so far on a particular project (with the ability to filter by date and time), so you can know exactly how much to charge each client.</p>
<p>From the user’s POV, you could have commands like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>freelance start project1</li>
<li>freelance stop project2</li>
</ul>
<p>And when in interactive mode, something like this should work:</p>
<ul>
<li>report project1 since 1/2/24</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge on this backend project is not just the CLI itself, which you’ve built in the past, but the actual time tracking logic that needs to happen internally. You’ll be keeping track of small chunks of time associated with different backend projects, and once the report is requested, you need to properly query your DB and get only the right chunks, so you can later add them up and return a valid number.</p>
<h2 id="19-js-obfuscator-cli-utility">19. JS Obfuscator CLI utility</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Very Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: code obfuscation, batch processing of files using a CLI, Node.js.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/js-obfuscator-utility-f0dfi.png" alt="JS Obfuscator CLI utility"></p>
<p>Code obfuscation happens when you turn a perfectly readable code into something that only a machine can understand, without changing the plain text nature of the file. In other words, you just make it impossible for a human to read and understand.</p>
<p>Many tools do this in the JS ecosystem, it’s now your turn to create a new tool and perform the exact same action. As an added difficulty, you’ll be coding a tool that does this to an entire folder filled with files (not just one at the time).</p>
<p>Make sure the output for each file is placed inside the same folder, with a “.obs.js” extension, and that you’re also navigating sub-folders searching for more files.</p>
<p>Try to avoid libraries that already perform these exact same tasks, as you’ll be skipping through all the potential problems you can find, and effectively learning nothing from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="20-web-scraper-cli">20. Web Scraper CLI</h2>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong>: Very Difficult</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills and technologies used</em></strong>: Web scraping, headless browsing, rules engine</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/webscraper-cli-ja5h2.png" alt="Web Scraper CLI"></p>
<p>A web scraper is a tool that allows you to navigate a website through code, and in the process, capture information from the presented web pages.</p>
<p>As part of the last backend project of this list, you’ll be implementing your very own web scraper CLI tool. This tool will take input from the user with a list of preset commands, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>show code: to list the HTML code of the current page.</li>
<li>navigate: to open a new URL</li>
<li>capture: this will return a subsection of the HTML of the current page using the CSS selector you specify.</li>
<li>click on: this command will trigger a click on a particular HTML element using a CSS selector provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to add extra commands to make the navigation even more interactive.</p>

<p>Version control systems are essential for managing changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate effectively and maintain a history of changes.</p>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>When it comes to picking the right version control tool, Git is the most widely used one. It provides a powerful, flexible, and distributed model for tracking changes. Git’s architecture supports nonlinear development, allowing multiple branches to be created, merged, and managed independently. This makes Git essential for code collaboration and version tracking, making it a foundational tool for any developer.</p>
<p>Let’s go through some of the key benefits that make Git one of the leading backend technologies in web development.</p>
<h4 id="distributed-version-control">Distributed Version Control</h4>
<p>Unlike centralized version control systems (CVCS) where a single central repository holds the entire project history, Git allows each developer to have a complete copy of the repository, including its history. This decentralized approach enhances collaboration and ensures that work can continue even if the central server is down.</p>
<h4 id="branching-and-merging">Branching and Merging</h4>
<p><strong>Branching</strong>: Git’s lightweight branching model allows developers to create, delete, and switch between branches effortlessly. This facilitates isolated development of features, bug fixes, or experiments without impacting the main codebase.</p>
<p><strong>Merging</strong>: Git provides powerful merging capabilities to integrate changes from different branches. Tools like merge commits and rebasing help manage and resolve conflicts, ensuring a smooth integration process.</p>
<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
<p>Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Its performance for both local operations (like committing and branching) and remote operations (like fetching and pushing changes) is optimized, making it suitable for high-performance needs.</p>
<h4 id="commit-history-and-tracking">Commit History and Tracking</h4>
<p>Commit Granularity: Git encourages frequent commits, each with a descriptive message, making it easier to track changes, understand the project history, and identify when and why a change was made.</p>
<p><strong>History Viewing</strong>: Commands like git log, git blame, and git bisect allow developers to explore the project’s history, pinpoint the introduction of bugs, and understand the evolution of the codebase.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>While strictly not part of Git’s feature set, these functionalities enhance the basic set of features provided by the version control system.</p>
<p><strong>Pull Requests</strong>: Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket build on Git’s capabilities, offering features like pull requests to facilitate code reviews and discussions before integrating changes into the main branch.</p>
<p><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: Integrating with continuous integration (CI) systems, Git platforms enable automated testing and code quality checks, ensuring that changes meet project standards before merging.</p>
<h4 id="staging-area">Staging Area</h4>
<p>Git’s staging area (or index) provides an intermediate area where changes can be formatted and reviewed before committing. This allows for more granular control over what changes are included in a commit.</p>
<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p>GitHub is a web-based platform that leverages Git for version control. It provides an extensive list of collaborative features, including (as already mentioned) pull requests, code reviews, and project management tools.</p>
<h4 id="key-features-and-benefits">Key Features and Benefits</h4>
<p><strong>Pull Requests and Code Reviews</strong>:  Facilitate discussions around proposed changes before integrating them into the main codebase. Developers can review code, leave comments, and suggest improvements.  Built-in tools for reviewing code changes ensure collaborations are following coding standards and catch potential issues early.</p>
<p><strong>Project Management</strong>: GitHub Issues allow tracking of bugs, enhancements, and tasks. Milestones help in organizing issues into targeted releases or sprints. Kanban-style boards provide a visual way to manage tasks, track progress, and organize workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment</strong>: Automate workflows for CI/CD, testing, deployment, and more. GitHub Actions supports custom scripts and pre-built actions to streamline DevOps processes.</p>
<p><strong>Community and Collaboration</strong>: Developers can host static websites directly from a GitHub repository with Github Pages, they’re ideal for project documentation or personal websites. Integrated wikis can be used for detailed project documentation. And through forking, starring, and following repositories the platform encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>GitHub’s extensive features and strong community support make it the de facto choice for many companies and developers, both for open-source and private projects.</p>
<h3 id="gitlab">GitLab</h3>
<p>GitLab is a web-based platform for version control using Git, known for its robust CI/CD pipeline integration. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for the entire DevOps lifecycle, making it suitable for continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring.</p>
<h4 id="key-features-and-benefits-1">Key Features and Benefits</h4>
<p><strong>Integrated CI/CD</strong>: Built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines allow backend developers to automate building, testing, and deploying code changes. With Gitlab they can even automatically configure CI/CD pipelines, deploy applications, and monitor performance, all through the same platform.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: Gitlab provides key security capabilities for backend development: built-in static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST).</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong>: Instead of Pull Requests like Github, Gitlab provides the concept of “Merge Requests”:  a simplified code review process with inline comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>GitLab’s all-in-one platform makes it an excellent choice for teams looking to streamline their DevOps processes and improve collaboration and productivity.</p>
<h3 id="bitbucket">Bitbucket</h3>
<p>Bitbucket is a Git-based source code repository hosting service that provides both commercial plans and free accounts for small teams. It integrates seamlessly with Atlassian products like Jira and Trello, making it a great choice for teams already using these tools.</p>
<p><strong>Repository Hosting</strong>: Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial version control systems. And it offers unlimited private repositories for teams.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Atlassian Products</strong>: Seamlessly integrates with Jira for issue tracking and project management. It can create branches from Jira issues and view development progress which is a fantastic integration for big teams using both tools. If, on the other hand, you’re using Trello, it can connect to Trello’s boards for visual task management and tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment</strong>: Integrated CI/CD service for automating builds, tests, and deployments. It can be configured with a YAML file for custom workflows.</p>

<p>Bitbucket’s integration with Atlassian’s suite of products, along with its robust CI/CD capabilities, make it an attractive option for teams seeking a tightly integrated development and project management environment.</p>
<h2 id="containerization-and-orchestration">Containerization and Orchestration</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/containers-and-orchestrators-jb6xj.png" alt="Containerization and Orchestration"></p>
<p>While backend developers aren’t always directly involved in the deployment process, understanding the basics of containerization and orchestration can help them work and interact with the team in charge of devops (who usually set up these CI/CD pipelines).</p>
<p>While this is not an exhaustive list of backend technologies, the two main ones to learn about are:</p>
<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package software and its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies application deployment and testing, making it ideal for microservices architectures and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="apis-and-web-services">APIs and Web Services</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/rest-vs-graphql-vs-grpc-tp40c.png" alt="APIs and Web Services"></p>
<p>APIs (or Application Programming Interfaces) and web services are another mandatory incorporation to the list of top backend technologies any developer should keep in mind. They enable communication between different software systems.</p>
<p>The three most common types of APIs right now, are REST, GraphQL and gPRC, let’s take a closer look at each one of them.</p>
<h3 id="rest">REST</h3>
<p>REST is a standard architecture for web services, known for its simplicity and scalability. It operates on stateless principles and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. RESTful APIs are typically used to access and manipulate web resources using URLs.</p>
<p>REST is ideal for web applications and services due to its ease of implementation and broad compatibility with various web technologies. It is commonly used for developing APIs for web and mobile applications, providing endpoints that clients can interact with to perform various operations. RESTful APIs are also ideal for integrating with third-party services, enabling data exchange and interaction between different systems.</p>
<h4 id="key-characteristics-of-rest">Key Characteristics of REST</h4>
<p><strong>Statelessness</strong>: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request, without relying on stored context on the server.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Interface</strong>: REST APIs follow standard conventions, making them easy to understand and use. This includes using standard HTTP methods and status codes.</p>
<p><strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong>: Separates the client and server concerns, improving scalability and flexibility. Clients handle the user interface and user experience, while servers handle data storage and business logic.</p>
<p><strong>Cacheability</strong>: Responses from REST APIs can be cached to improve performance, reducing the need for repeated requests.</p>
<p><strong>Layered System</strong>: REST allows for a layered system architecture, enabling intermediaries like load balancers and proxy servers to enhance security, performance, and scalability.</p>
<p>If you’d like to know more about REST, you can read the full definition directly from <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">its source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="graphql">GraphQL</h3>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. Unlike REST, where multiple endpoints return fixed data structures, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need. This flexibility reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and can significantly improve performance.</p>
<p>GraphQL is ideal for applications with complex and dynamic data requirements.</p>
<h4 id="key-characteristics-of-graphql">Key Characteristics of GraphQL</h4>
<p><strong>Declarative Data Fetching</strong>: Clients specify the structure of the response, ensuring they receive only the data they need.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly Typed Schema</strong>: The API schema is strongly typed, providing clear and detailed documentation of available data and operations.</p>
<p><strong>Single Endpoint</strong>: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to serve all requests, simplifying the API architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time Data</strong>: Supports real-time updates through subscriptions, enabling clients to receive live data changes.</p>
<h3 id="grpc">gRPC</h3>
<p>gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. gRPC is designed for low-latency, high-throughput communication, making it suitable for microservices architectures and real-time communication systems.</p>
<p>gRPC is ideal for applications that require efficient, reliable, and bi-directional communication.</p>
<h4 id="key-characteristics-of-grpc">Key Characteristics of gRPC</h4>
<p><strong>Protocol Buffers</strong>: Uses Protocol Buffers for compact, efficient, and platform-neutral serialization of structured data.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP/2</strong>: Utilizes HTTP/2 for multiplexing, flow control, header compression, and efficient binary transport.</p>
<p><strong>Bi-directional Streaming</strong>: Supports multiple types of streaming, including client-side, server-side, and bi-directional streaming.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Language Compatibility</strong>: Provides support for multiple backend programming languages, enabling interoperability between different systems.</p>
<h2 id="caching-systems">Caching Systems</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/working-cache-11kis.png" alt="Caching Systems"></p>
<p>Caching systems store copies of frequently accessed data to reduce latency and improve application performance. They are essential for speeding up data retrieval and reducing the load on primary data stores.</p>
<p>Implementing a successful caching strategy is not trivial, and one key aspect of it is the backend technology used for the implementation. While there might be multiple options out there, the industry currently recognizes only one de facto choice: Redis.</p>
<h3 id="redis-a-fast-in-memory-storage-solution">Redis: a fast in-memory storage solution</h3>
<p>Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can function as a database, cache, and message broker.

<p>As backend developers, understanding how to take advantage of these message queues is critical to the development of scalable and resilient platforms. It is definitely a must-have skill and you need to master it.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/authentication-vs-authorization-vl6lg.png" alt="Authentication and Authorization"></p>
<p>Authentication and authorization technologies are essential for securing applications, ensuring that users are who they claim to be and have the appropriate permissions to access resources.</p>
<p>This space is filled with solutions and methodologies, so it’s not easy to pick one option here, however, these two are very common solutions used to implement both, authZ (authorization) and authN (authentication).</p>
<h3 id="oauth">OAuth</h3>
<p>OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to a user’s information without exposing their passwords. It is widely used in single sign-on (SSO) systems, enabling users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials. OAuth is ideal for third-party applications that need access to user data, such as social media integrations and API access management.</p>
<h3 id="jwt-json-web-tokens">JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</h3>
<p>JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object, which is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, providing a secure way to transmit information between parties. They are particularly useful in stateless authentication systems, where user state is not stored on the server (like when dealing with RESTful APIs).</p>
<h2 id="cicd-pipelines">CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continous-development-vs-continuous-integration-rg7t9.png" alt="CI/CD Pipelines"></p>
<p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of code integration, testing, and deployment, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.

<p>In this guide today will be talking about what authentication is, and we will cover some terminology that will help us later in the series. You can watch the video below or continue reading this guide.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mcyt9SrZT6g" title="Basics of Authentication"></iframe>
<h2 id="what-is-authentication">What is Authentication?</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying someone’s identity. A real-world example of that would be when you board a plane, the airline worker checks your passport to verify your identity, so the airport worker authenticates you.</p>
<p>If we talk about computers, when you log in to any website, you usually authenticate yourself by entering your username and password, which is then checked by the website to ensure that you are who you claim to be. There are two things you should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication is not only for the persons</li>
<li>And username and password are not the only way to authenticate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you open a website in the browser. If the website uses HTTP, TLS is used to authenticate the server and avoid the fake loading of websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There might be server-to-server communication on the website. The server may need to authenticate the incoming request to avoid malicious usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-authentication-work">How does Authentication Work?</h2>
<p>On a high level, we have the following factors used for authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username and Password</strong></li>
<li><strong>Security Codes, Pin Codes, or Security Questions</strong> — An example would be the pin code you enter at an ATM to withdraw cash.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Tokens and Soft Tokens</strong> — Hard tokens are the special hardware devices that you attach to your device to authenticate yourself. Soft tokens, unlike hard tokens, don’t have any authentication-specific device; we must verify the possession of a device that was used to set up the identity. For example, you may receive an OTP to log in to your account on a website.</li>
<li><strong>Biometric Authentication</strong> — In biometric authentication, we authenticate using biometrics such as iris, facial, or voice recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can categorize the factors above into three different types.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username / Password and Security codes rely on the person’s knowledge: we can group them under the <strong>Knowledge Factor</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In hard and soft tokens, we authenticate by checking the possession of hardware, so this would be a <strong>Possession Factor</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And in biometrics, we test the person’s inherent qualities, i.e., iris, face, or voice, so this would be a <strong>Qualities</strong> factor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings us to our next topic: Multi-factor Authentication and Two-Factor Authentication.</p>
<h2 id="multifactor-authentication">Multifactor Authentication</h2>
<p>Multifactor authentication is the type of authentication in which we rely on more than one factor to authenticate a user.</p>
<p>For example, if we pick up username/password from the <strong>knowledge factor</strong>. And we pick soft tokens from the <strong>possession factor</strong>, and we say that for a user to authenticate, they must enter their credentials and an OTP, which will be sent to their mobile phone, so this would be an example of multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>In multifactor authentication, since we rely on more than one factor, this way of authentication is much more secure than single-factor authentication.</p>
<p>One important thing to note here is that the factors you pick for authentication, they must differ. So, for example, if we pick up a username/password and security question or security codes, it is still not true multifactor authentication because we still rely on the knowledge factor. The factors have to be different from each other.</p>
<h3 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication is similar to multifactor authentication. The only difference is that there are precisely two factors in 2FA. In MFA, we can have 2, 3, 4, or any authentication factors; 2FA has exactly two factors. We can say that 2FA is always MFA, because there are more than one factors. MFA is not always 2FA because there may be more than two factors involved.</p>
<p>Next we have the difference between authentication and authorization. This comes up a lot in the interviews, and beginners often confuse them.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-authentication-1">What is Authentication</h3>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity. For example, when you enter your credentials at a login screen, the application here identifies you through your credentials. So this is what the authentication is, the process of verifying the identity.</p>
<p>In case of an authentication failure, for example, if you enter an invalid username and password, the HTTP response code is “Unauthorized” 401.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-authorization">What is Authorization</h3>
<p>Authorization is the process of checking permission. Once the user has logged in, i.e., the user has been authenticated, the process of reviewing the permission to see if the user can perform the relevant operation or not is called authorization.</p>
<p>And in case of authorization failure, i.e., if the user tries to perform an operation they are not allowed to perform, the HTTP response code is forbidden 403.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-strategies">Authentication Strategies</h2>
<p>Given below is the list of common authentication strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Authentication</li>
<li>Session Based Authentication</li>
<li>Token-Based Authentication</li>
<li>JWT Authentication</li>
<li>OAuth - Open Authorization</li>
<li>Single Sign On (SSO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this series of illustrated videos and textual guides, we will be going through each of the strategies discussing what they are, how they are implemented, the pros and cons and so on.</p>
<p>So stay tuned, and I will see you in the next one.</p>`,$s={title:"Basics of Authentication",description:"Learn the basics of Authentication and Authorization",authorId:"kamran",seo:{title:"Basics of Authentication - roadmap.sh",description:"Learn the basics of Authentication and Authorization"},isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","textual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},_s="/workspace/src/data/guides/basics-of-authentication.md",Js=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=$s;return e.file=_s,e.url=Js,l`${p()}${r(Hs())}`});const Ns=()=>`<p>Big-O notation is the mathematical notation that helps analyse the algorithms to get an idea about how they might perform as the input grows.

<p>A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</h2>
<p>Imagine we have an e-commerce application where we are selling books. This application may consist of multiple different components. For example, one server might be responsible for the accounts, another might be responsible for the payments, one might be responsible for storing orders, one might be responsible for loyalty points and relevant functionalities, and another might be responsible for maintaining the books inventory and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VHATt7a.png" alt="Book Store - Distributed System"></p>
<p>Now, if a user buys a book, there might be different services involved in placing the order; order service for storing the order, payment service for handling the payments, and inventory service for keeping the stock of that ordered book up to date. This is an example of a distributed system, an application that consists of multiple different components, each of which is responsible for a different part of the application.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-consistency-important">Why is Consistency Important?</h2>
<p>When working with distributed systems, we need to think about managing the data across different servers. If we take the above example of the e-commerce application, we can see that the inventory service must have up-to-date stock information for the ordered items if the user places an order. Now, there might be two different users looking at the same book. Now imagine if one of the customers places a successful order, and before the inventory service can update the stock, the second customer also places the order for the same book. In that case, when the inventory wasn’t updated, we will have the wrong stock information when the second order was placed, i.e., the ordered book may or may not be available in stock. This is where different consistency patterns come into play. They help ensure that the data is consistent across the application.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-patterns">Consistency Patterns</h2>
<p>Consistency patterns refer to the ways in which data is stored and managed in a distributed system and how that data is made available to users and applications. There are three main types of consistency patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong consistency</li>
<li>Weak consistency</li>
<li>Eventual Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these patterns has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which pattern to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application or system.</p>
<h3 id="strong-consistency">Strong Consistency</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After an update is made to the data, it will be immediately visible to any subsequent read operations. The data is replicated in a synchronous manner, ensuring that all copies of the data are updated at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a strong consistency system, any updates to some data are immediately propagated to all locations. This ensures that all locations have the same version of the data, but it also means that the system is not highly available and has high latency.</p>
<p>An example of strong consistency is a financial system where users can transfer money between accounts. The system is designed for <strong>high data integrity</strong>, so the data is stored in a single location and updates to that data are immediately propagated to all other locations. This ensures that all users and applications are working with the same, accurate data. For instance, when a user initiates a transfer of funds from one account to another, the system immediately updates the balance of both accounts and all other system components are immediately aware of the change. This ensures that all users can see the updated balance of both accounts and prevents any discrepancies.</p>
<h3 id="weak-consistency">Weak Consistency</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After an update is made to the data, it is not guaranteed that any subsequent read operation will immediately reflect the changes made. The read <strong>may or may not</strong> see the recent write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a weakly consistent system, updates to the data may not be immediately propagated. This can lead to inconsistencies and conflicts between different versions of the data, but it also allows for <strong>high availability and low latency</strong>.</p>
<p>Another example of weak consistency is a gaming platform where users can play online multiplayer games. When a user plays a game, their actions are immediately visible to other players in the same data center, but if there was a lag or temporary connection loss, the actions may not be seen by some of the users and the game will continue. This can lead to inconsistencies between different versions of the game state, but it also allows for a high level of availability and low latency.</p>
<h3 id="eventual-consistency">Eventual Consistency</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventual consistency is a form of Weak Consistency. After an update is made to the data, it will be eventually visible to any subsequent read operations. The data is replicated in an asynchronous manner, ensuring that all copies of the data are eventually updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an eventually consistent system, data is typically stored in multiple locations, and updates to that data are eventually propagated to all locations. This means that the system is highly available and has low latency, but it also means that there may be inconsistencies and conflicts between different versions of the data.</p>
<p>An example of eventual consistency is a social media platform where users can post updates, comments, and messages. The platform is designed for high availability and low latency, so the data is stored in multiple data centers around the world. When a user posts an update, the update is immediately visible to other users in the same data center, but it may take some time for the update to propagate to other data centers. This means that some users may see the update while others may not, depending on which data center they are connected to. This can lead to inconsistencies between different versions of the data, but it also allows for a high level of availability and low latency.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, consistency patterns play a crucial role in distributed systems, and the choice of which pattern to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application or system. Each pattern has its own advantages and disadvantages, and each is more suitable for different use cases. Weak consistency is suitable for systems that require high availability and low latency, strong consistency is suitable for systems that require high data integrity, and eventual consistency is suitable for systems that require both high availability and high data integrity.</p>`,tt={title:"Consistency Patterns",description:"Everything you need to know about Week, Strong and Eventual Consistency",authorId:"kamran",seo:{title:"Consistency Patterns - roadmap.sh",description:"Everything you need to know about Week, Strong and Eventual Consistency"},isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","visual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},ot="/workspace/src/data/guides/consistency-patterns-in-distributed-systems.md",it=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=tt;return e.file=ot,e.url=it,l`${p()}${r(st())}`});const rt=()=>`<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-analyst-career-path-heu4b.jpg" alt="Choosing your data analyst career path"></p>

<h2 id="my-tips-from-personal-experience">My tips from personal experience</h2>
<p>With all of this out of the way, let me quickly run you through some of my personal tips when it comes to growing and moving forward as a data analyst.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build a strong network and find mentors:</strong> Connect with other data analysts, data scientists, and analytics managers through LinkedIn groups, local meetups, or virtual conferences. Ask others who have gone through the same about their journey, about the problems they found along the way. Learn from them.</li>
<li><strong>Showcase your work with purpose:</strong> Your first data analyst job will depend on having a solid portfolio (since you don’t have any actual experience). Try to host your projects on GitHub or a personal blog, and include clear READMEs that explain your data strategy, the tech stack you used, and the business impact (showing you understand the value of your work), whether it’s “increased conversion rate by X%” or “optimized inventory planning”.</li>
<li><strong>Stay ahead with the latest tools and techniques:</strong> Data visualization tools and programming languages are constantly evolving. One key language you’ll be using quite regularly is SQL, and if you ignore it, your progress will slow down. Find yourself a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL Course</a> that works for you and ensure you master it as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace feedback and cultivate a growth mindset:</strong> Whether you’re presenting to marketing teams or senior management, feedback is your friend. After each project or presentation, or even on a regular basis try to get constructive feedback on your data modeling, storytelling, and communication style. Use this input to refine your processes, improving both your essential skills and your ability to communicate insights.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for credentials that matter:</strong> Getting credentials that validate your expertise with a certain tool or a type of analysis is going to help you stand out in the sea of analysts fighting for the same position. So, consider pursuing data analytics certifications (e.g., Google Data Analytics or Microsoft Power BI). They will not ensure you get the job, but they’ll help you demonstrate a certain level of expertise at first glance.</li>

<p>Breaking into the data analytics industry can be scary, especially when you have no prior background in data analysis.</p>
<p>Yet the need for entry-level data analysts has never been higher, data is at the heart of everything, and organizations across the globe depend on data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions in every area of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Many aspiring data professionals incorrectly believe that a degree in computer science or a long resume in data science is a prerequisite for anything. The truth is that mastering the <strong>data analysis process</strong>, building a solid <strong>analytics portfolio</strong>, and showcasing your <strong>data skills</strong> can open doors to your first <strong>junior data analyst</strong> role, just like a long resume or a fancy degree.</p>
<p>In this practical guide on how to become a data analyst with no experience, I’m going to show you the key skills you should focus your learning path on (like SQL and statistical analysis).</p>
<p>I’ll also prepare you on how to hone critical soft skills and leverage expert resources such as the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/data-analyst" target="_blank">Data Analyst Roadmap</a> and this <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> to help you improve your skills in that language.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-master-the-essential-data-analyst-skills">Step 1: Master the Essential Data Analyst Skills</h2>
<p>In the analysis life cycle (from data collection and unprocessed data wrangling to statistical modeling and presentation), some <strong>techniques</strong> and <strong>skills (both technical and non-technical)</strong> are non-negotiable. The first thing you have to do is to focus on these core areas to build a solid foundation for your first <strong>entry-level data analyst</strong> or <strong>junior data analyst</strong> role:</p>
<h3 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills:</h3>
<p>A data analyst’s toolkit revolves around five foundational technical domains, each critical to unlocking insights from raw data and driving informed decisions. Begin by mastering <strong>Structured Query Language (SQL)</strong>, the backbone of relational data interrogation. With our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank"><strong>SQL course on roadmap.sh</strong></a>, you will learn to write complex queries—filtering, joining, aggregations, and advanced window functions—that enable you to extract and <strong>manipulate data</strong> at scale.</p>
<p>Next, tackle Data cleansing and Manipulation, the art of transforming messy inputs into reliable analytical datasets. Utilizing libraries such as pandas in Python or dplyr in R, you will develop workflows for handling missing values, normalizing formats, and removing duplicates, thereby ensuring high <strong>data quality</strong> before any modeling or visualization begins.</p>
<p>With a pristine dataset in hand, dive into different Analysis techniques to derive meaningful patterns. Key concepts such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlations, and regression form the core of <strong>these analysis techniques</strong> used to validate assumptions and generate <strong>actionable insights</strong>. Proficiency in these methods equips you to support business cases with evidence-backed conclusions.</p>
<p>Translating numerical results into compelling narratives requires strong <strong>Data Visualization</strong> skills. Whether you choose Tableau, Power BI, or Python’s matplotlib and seaborn libraries, you will create interactive dashboards and visual stories that highlight trends, outliers, and opportunities. Effective visualization not only conveys findings clearly but also drives stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>Finally, solid programming skills in Python or R tie your analytical process together. From automating repetitive tasks and integrating APIs to building end-to-end <strong>data analytics</strong> pipelines, a programming mindset enables scalability, reproducibility, and integration of advanced tools, positioning you for roles across the industry.</p>
<h3 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills:</h3>
<p>In the realm of data analytics, technical prowess must be complemented by strong interpersonal abilities (i.e, soft skills). Analytical thinking and structured problem-solving are at the heart of your daily workflow. When you encounter complex datasets, you must decide which analysis techniques best uncover the story hidden in the numbers.</p>
<p>This thoughtful approach ensures you derive accurate, actionable insights from unprocessed data.</p>
<p>Equally vital is the capacity to interpret data and translate it into meaningful recommendations. Effective communication means crafting a narrative around your findings that resonates with diverse audiences, from C-suite executives to frontline team members.</p>
<p>By designing clear visualizations and presenting data insights through compelling dashboards or concise slide decks, you empower stakeholders to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Documenting every phase of your analysis process (data collection, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and reporting) creates a transparent audit trail. This meticulous record-keeping not only bolsters confidence in your results but also sets the foundation for reproducibility and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Collaboration and adaptability define success in dynamic business environments. As a business intelligence analyst, sales data analyst, or healthcare data analyst, you’ll partner with professionals across marketing, finance, operations, and IT.</p>
<p>Learning to navigate different communication styles, incorporating feedback, and swiftly adopting new tools or programming skills are essential to deliver timely, value-driven analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, incorporate a growth mindset by viewing every project as an opportunity to refine your soft skills. Seek constructive feedback from mentors and peers, participate in cross-functional workshops, and mentor aspiring professionals. Cultivating empathy, resilience, and lifelong learning habits ensures you evolve into a well-rounded data analyst capable of driving organizational success.</p>
<p>Starting with these essential skills will give you the confidence to tackle <strong>data-projects</strong>, close the <strong>data skills gap</strong>, and stand out among <strong>aspiring analysts</strong> in a competitive <strong>job market.</strong> After the foundation is done, you’re free to specialize and focus in the areas that you feel are more appealing to you.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-follow-a-structured-learning-path">Step 2: Follow a Structured Learning Path</h2>

<li><strong>Interactive Dashboards</strong>: Build dashboards with Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly to <strong>visualize data</strong> trends and present insights; add filters, annotations, and user controls.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-Specific Projects</strong>: Create analyses for niche roles—e.g.,  evaluate patient outcomes as a <strong>healthcare data analyst</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Storytelling</strong>: Craft a narrative-driven project (e.g., COVID-19 trends, climate data) combining charts, maps, and written insights to tell a compelling story.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you don’t really know how to begin working on them, you can simply ask one of the many LLMs available online to give you a detailed project plan, and start working on it. You’ll be closing projects right and left in no time.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<p>Where should you create your portfolio? What tech stack should you use? How often should you update it? When should you publish it?<br>
These are all valid questions that don’t have a single answer, however, I can show you some of the best practices I’ve seen around throughout my career when it comes to building data analyst portfolios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host projects on GitHub with clear READMEs, organized code, and visual previews.</li>
<li>Document your <strong>analysis life cycle</strong> in Jupyter notebooks or blog posts, explaining each step and decision.</li>
<li>Use authentic tools and workflows: query public APIs with <strong>SQL</strong>, automate tasks with Python or R, and integrate BI tools.</li>
<li>Continuously update your portfolio as you learn new <strong>data analysis techniques</strong> and <strong>programming skills</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-4-gain-practical-experience">Step 4: Gain Practical Experience</h2>
<p>Securing practical experience allows you to apply theoretical knowledge, bridge the skills gap, and prove to hiring managers that you can deliver on real-world data analysis projects. Here are several pathways to get your foot in the door:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internships &#x26; Volunteer Projects:</strong><br>
Look for data internships (even unpaid if you can) or volunteer to help non‑profits, student organizations, or local businesses with their <strong>data collection</strong>, <strong>data cleaning</strong>, and <strong>data visualization</strong> needs. These roles not only strengthen your <strong>technical skills</strong> but also give you concrete examples for your <strong>data analytics portfolio</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Freelance &#x26; Gig Work:</strong><br>
Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or even LinkedIn can connect you with short‑term gigs, everything from database queries to dashboard creation. Freelance tasks force you to <strong>manipulate data</strong>, produce <strong>actionable insights</strong>, and <strong>present data-driven insights</strong> under real-world deadlines, building both technical chops and business communication skills.</li>
<li><strong>Entry‑Level &#x26; Support Roles:</strong><br>
Apply for roles labeled <strong>data technician</strong>, <strong>data entry</strong>, or <strong>junior data analyst</strong>. These positions often focus on <strong>data quality</strong>, routine reports, and simple analyses; they’re perfect stepping stones that let you collaborate with senior analysts and refine your <strong>analysis</strong> and <strong>manipulation</strong> techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Kaggle Competitions &#x26; Public Challenges:</strong><br>
I’ve mentioned this platform before, but consider participating in Kaggle or similar platforms to demonstrate your ability to tackle problems like a <strong>fraud detection</strong> challenge or sales forecasting. Even if you don’t win, documenting your approach, code, and learnings shows resilience and a methodical <strong>analysis process</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Capstone &#x26; Guided Projects:</strong><br>
Many certification programs include capstone projects. Treat these as mini‑portfolio pieces: choose datasets relevant to your target roles, and clearly outline your <strong>data analysis life cycle</strong>, from <strong>raw data</strong> ingestion through <strong>data visualization</strong> and storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build experience in as many diverse <strong>practical experiences as you can</strong>. That way, you’ll not only close any <strong>data skills gap</strong> you might have, but also amass a collection of tangible accomplishments, making it far easier to articulate your value as an <strong>aspiring data analyst</strong> during interviews.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-network-and-engage-with-the-data-community">Step 5: Network and Engage with the Data Community</h2>
<p>Spending time in the right communities accelerates your growth as an <strong>aspiring data analyst</strong> by helping you stay current with industry trends, learn from seasoned <strong>professionals</strong>, and uncover hidden <strong>data analytics job</strong> opportunities. After all, a big part of growing in any technology role is about networking (shocking, I know!) with other professionals who’ve gone through what you’re going through now and can provide advice, help, or even a boost when least expected.</p>
<p>Networking is not easy, and there are many ways to do it. Here’s just one example of how to build and leverage your own network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage Professional Platforms:</strong> Connect with <strong>qualified data analysts</strong> and <strong>data scientists</strong> on LinkedIn, GitHub, and specialized forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit’s r/datascience. Engage by asking thoughtful questions, sharing your <strong>data analysis projects</strong>, and commenting on discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Attend Industry Events:</strong> Participate in local meetups, virtual conferences, webinars, and workshops hosted by organizations such as Data Science Saudi, Meetup groups, or platform-specific events (e.g., Tableau User Groups). These gatherings expose you to emerging <strong>analysis techniques</strong>, <strong>data visualization</strong> best practices, and evolving industry standards.</li>
<li><strong>Join Online Communities:</strong> Become active in Slack channels, Discord servers, or professional associations where <strong>data analysts</strong> share resources, job leads, and <strong>actionable insights</strong>. Regularly review community channels for project feedback, collaboration opportunities, and announcements about <strong>entry-level data analyst</strong> roles.</li>
<li><strong>Find a Mentor or Buddy:</strong> Seek out mentorship programs through bootcamps or university-alumni networks. A mentor, someone like a <strong>senior data analyst</strong> or BI (<strong>business intelligence) analyst</strong>, can provide personalized advice on your <strong>data analysis life cycle</strong>, resume reviews, and mock interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Share Your Knowledge:</strong> Contribute to blogs, record tutorials, or present lightning talks at virtual events. While you might just be starting, chances are someone else is going through the same process, and learning how you solved it can help them. Also, creating content like this will force you to truly understand the topic you’re covering before being able to explain it. So even while you’re teaching others, you’re also cementing that understanding within you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Networking is not easy, and when you’re just getting started, it might seem even harder than getting an actual data analyst job. The above list is just a set of options, you don’t have to go through all of them (or any, to be honest), just find a way that works for you and follow that path.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-continuous-learning-and-career-development">Step 6: Continuous Learning and Career Development</h2>
<p>The analytics industry is constantly evolving, and your professional growth must keep up accordingly. Continuous learning is probably one of the only ways to ensure you stay ahead of emerging trends, refine your existing skills, and prepare for more advanced roles.</p>
<h3 id="lifelong-learning-and-advanced-skills">Lifelong Learning and Advanced Skills</h3>
<p>You should embrace a mindset of lifelong learning by deepening your technical expertise over time. Accept that you’ll never be done learning and revisit fundamental tools like SQL and master advanced features such as window functions and recursive queries.</p>
<p>Expand your proficiency in Python by exploring libraries like pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning workflows. If you prefer R, dive into packages like tidyverse for efficient data processing and ggplot2 for sophisticated visualizations.</p>
<p>Additionally, enroll in specialized courses on machine learning algorithms, cloud-based analytics platforms (e.g., AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery), and emerging open-source tools. Staying informed through industry blogs, podcasts, and research publications will help you hone your skills in both data science and data mining.</p>
<h3 id="charting-your-career-path">Charting Your Career Path</h3>
<p>Once you have a solid foundation in data analysis techniques, the next step is to start mapping out your career trajectory. In other words: where do you want to go?</p>
<p>Initially, you might specialize as a BI analyst, crafting interactive dashboards and KPI reports that inform strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Next, consider roles such as sales data analyst, where you’ll focus on revenue analytics and customer behavior modeling, or healthcare analyst, tasked with evaluating patient outcomes and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>As you gain experience, you might want to pivot toward senior data analyst or data scientist positions, taking on end-to-end projects that incorporate predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and advanced statistical analysis.</p>
<h3 id="setting-goals-and-measuring-progress">Setting Goals and Measuring Progress</h3>
<p>You can’t know if you’re moving in the right direction if you don’t measure your progress. It’s a very common mistake many new analysts make, and one you should try to avoid.</p>
<p>Define clear, measurable objectives to guide your learning journey. Set milestones—such as completing a certification, publishing a portfolio project, or mastering a new visualization tool (and celebrate each achievement once you get it).</p>
<p>Keep a learning journal or log within your portfolio to document projects, record the techniques applied, and reflect on lessons learned.</p>
<p>Regularly try to get feedback from peers and mentors through code reviews, presentations, or mock interviews to identify areas for improvement and validate your progress.</p>
<h3 id="mentorship-and-community-involvement">Mentorship and Community Involvement</h3>
<p>Long-term success in data analysis relies on strong professional relationships and community engagement. Continue participating in forums, meetups, and virtual conferences to exchange insights with both aspiring analysts and seasoned professionals.</p>
<p>Seek opportunities to mentor newcomers, contribute to open-source or community-driven data projects, and share your expertise through blog posts or lightning talks.</p>
<p>Teaching concepts such as data cleansing, analysis workflows, and visualization best practices not only reinforces your own knowledge but also establishes your reputation as a qualified data professional in the broader data analyst job market.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate these strategies into your routine; that way, you’ll enhance your data analyst skills dynamically, showcase your commitment to growth, and position yourself for roles with greater responsibility and impact.</p>

They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia describes them as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="be-careful">Be Careful</h2>
<p>Developers, mostly beginners, make the mistake of over-thinking and forcing the design patterns which results in a horrible un-maintainable mess. The rule of thumb is to keep the codebase as simple as possible, once you start developing, you will start to see the patterns repeating in the codebase in which case you can go ahead and implement the relevant design patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.</li>
<li>Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions <strong>to</strong> problems, not solutions <strong>finding</strong> problems; so don’t overthink.</li>
<li>If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Also note that the code samples below are in PHP-7, however this shouldn’t stop you because the concepts are same anyways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="types-of-design-patterns">Types of Design Patterns</h2>
<p>This guide is about Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which refers to the four authors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the book which introduced these design patterns</a>. There are three types of design patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#creational-design-patterns">Creational</a></li>
<li><a href="#structural-design-patterns">Structural</a></li>
<li><a href="#behavioral-design-patterns">Behavioral</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creational-design-patterns">Creational Design Patterns</h2>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 6 types of Creational patterns</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#-simple-factory">Simple Factory</a></li>
<li><a href="#-factory-method">Factory Method</a></li>
<li><a href="#-abstract-factory">Abstract Factory</a></li>
<li><a href="#-builder">Builder</a></li>
<li><a href="#-prototype">Prototype</a></li>
<li><a href="#-singleton">Singleton</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-simple-factory">🏠 Simple Factory</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. You can either put on your carpenter clothes, bring some wood, glue, nails and all the tools required to build the door and start building it in your house or you can simply call the factory and get the built door delivered to you so that you don’t need to learn anything about the door making or to deal with the mess that comes with making it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be “new”.</p>

<p><strong>When to Use?</strong></p>
<p>When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="-factory-method">🏭 Factory Method</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<p>Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn’t know what exact sub-class it might need.</p>
<h2 id="-abstract-factory">🔨 Abstract Factory</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extending our door example from Simple Factory. Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>Translating the door example above. First of all we have our <code>Door</code> interface and some implementation for it</p>

<p>As you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the <code>carpenter</code> and the <code>wooden door</code> also iron door factory has encapsulated the <code>iron door</code> and <code>welder</code>. And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.</p>
<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<p>When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved</p>
<h2 id="-builder">👷 Builder</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you are at Hardee’s and you order a specific deal, lets say, “Big Hardee” and they hand it over to you without <em>any questions</em>; this is the example of simple factory. But there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what types of sauces would you like? What cheese would you want? etc. In such cases builder pattern comes to the rescue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.</p>

<p>Having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="php"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">public</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> function</span><span style="color:#8BE9FD"> __construct</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">($size, $cheese </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> true</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, $pepperoni </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> true</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, $tomato </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> false</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, $lettuce </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> true</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">)</span></span>

<p>As you can see; the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want to add more options in future. This is called telescoping constructor anti-pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>The sane alternative is to use the builder pattern. First of all we have our burger that we want to make</p>

<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<p>When there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping. The key difference from the factory pattern is that; factory pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process.</p>
<h2 id="-prototype">🐑 Prototype</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create object based on an existing object through cloning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.</p>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>In PHP, it can be easily done using <code>clone</code></p>

<p>Also you could use the magic method <code>__clone</code> to modify the cloning behavior.</p>
<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<p>When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.</p>
<h2 id="-singleton">💍 Singleton</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can only be one president of a country at a time. The same president has to be brought to action, whenever duty calls. President here is singleton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Singleton pattern is actually considered an anti-pattern and overuse of it should be avoided. It is not necessarily bad and could have some valid use-cases but should be used with caution because it introduces a global state in your application and change to it in one place could affect in the other areas and it could become pretty difficult to debug. The other bad thing about them is it makes your code tightly coupled plus mocking the singleton could be difficult.</p>

<h2 id="structural-design-patterns">Structural Design Patterns</h2>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering “How to build a software component?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 7 types of structural patterns</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#-adapter">Adapter</a></li>
<li><a href="#-bridge">Bridge</a></li>
<li><a href="#-composite">Composite</a></li>

<li><a href="#-proxy">Proxy</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-adapter">🔌 Adapter</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can’t be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.</p>

<h2 id="-bridge">🚡 Bridge</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow the user to change the theme. What would you do? Create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the user’s preferences? Bridge pattern allows you to do the second i.e.</p>

<p>In Plain Words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance. Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to “decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently”</p>

<h2 id="-composite">🌿 Composite</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.</p>

<h2 id="-decorator">☕ Decorator</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.</p>

<h2 id="-facade">📦 Facade</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you turn on the computer? “Hit the power button” you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.</p>

<h2 id="-flyweight">🍃 Flyweight</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you ever have fresh tea from some stall? They often make more than one cup that you demanded and save the rest for any other customer so to save the resources e.g. gas etc. Flyweight pattern is all about that i.e. sharing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern. A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.</p>

<h2 id="-proxy">🎱 Proxy</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door’s main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let me better explain it using the code example below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another example would be some sort of data-mapper implementation. For example, I recently made an ODM (Object Data Mapper) for MongoDB using this pattern where I wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method <code>__call()</code>. All the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case of <code>find</code> or <code>findOne</code> data was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead of <code>Cursor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-design-patterns">Behavioral Design Patterns</h2>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don’t just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering “How to run a behavior in software component?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 10 types of behavioral design patterns</p>

<h2 id="-chain-of-responsibility">🔗 Chain of Responsibility</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you have three payment methods (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. <code>A</code> has 100 USD, <code>B</code> has 300 USD and <code>C</code> having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as <code>A</code> then <code>B</code> then <code>C</code>. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account <code>A</code> will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account <code>B</code> checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts</p>

<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e. <code>Client</code>) ask the waiter (i.e. <code>Invoker</code>) to bring some food (i.e. <code>Command</code>) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. <code>Receiver</code>) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook.
Another example would be you (i.e. <code>Client</code>) switching on (i.e. <code>Command</code>) the television (i.e. <code>Receiver</code>) using a remote control (<code>Invoker</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.</p>

<p>Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the <code>undo</code> on all the executed commands.</p>
<h2 id="-iterator">➿ Iterator</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container’s elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic example</strong></p>
<p>In PHP it is quite easy to implement using SPL (Standard PHP Library). Translating our radio stations example from above. First of all we have <code>RadioStation</code></p>

<h2 id="-mediator">👽 Mediator</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don’t need to have the knowledge of each other’s implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program’s running behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>Here is the simplest example of a chat room (i.e. mediator) with users (i.e. colleagues) sending messages to each other.</p>
<p>First of all, we have the mediator i.e. the chat room</p>

<h2 id="-memento">💾 Memento</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons (i.e. caretaker).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want.</p>
<p>First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state</p>

<h2 id="-visitor">🏃 Visitor</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic example</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let’s translate this using visitor pattern</p>

<p>We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let’s say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.</p>

<h2 id="-strategy">💡 Strategy</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm’s behavior to be selected at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="-state">💢 State</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern’s superclass.
The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern’s interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic example</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take an example of text editor, it lets you change the state of text that is typed i.e. if you have selected bold, it starts writing in bold, if italic then in italics etc.</p>

<h2 id="-template-method">📒 Template Method</h2>
<p>Real world example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the base of house</li>
<li>Build the walls</li>
<li>Add roof</li>
<li>Add other floors</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can’t build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Programmatic Example</strong></p>
<p>Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.</p>
<p>First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm</p>

<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> is like the ultimate team-up between development and operations teams, constantly looking to deliver software faster and more reliably. It all boils down to breaking silos, fostering collaboration, and continuously improving the development lifecycle. After all, developers and operations are just two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Now, imagine trying to keep everything running smoothly but doing it manually—sounds like a recipe for chaos, right? <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">Automation in DevOps</a> is crucial because it streamlines workflows and minimizes human intervention.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll dive into the <strong>6 best DevOps automation tools</strong> that can help you streamline your workflow and keep your projects on track. Here’s the full list of the tools we’ll be covering:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub Actions</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Puppet</li>
<li>Terraform</li>
<li>AWS CloudFormation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="criteria-for-selecting-the-best-devops-automation-tools">Criteria for Selecting the Best DevOps Automation Tools</h2>
<p>Choosing the right DevOps automation tools is crucial for optimizing your workflow and ensuring smooth operations. To help you navigate the vast landscape of available options, let’s break down the primary categories of automation tools that you’ll encounter in the DevOps ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-to-consider">Key Features to Consider</h3>
<p>Before diving into the actual DevOps automation tools, it’s important to keep in mind the key features that make a DevOps tool stand out.</p>
<p>While we won’t delve into the specifics here, remember to consider aspects like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration capabilities</strong>: how well do these tools work with others in the DevOps ecosystem? Considering we’re reviewing automation-related tools, the more and easier they integrate with other systems, the better they’ll be.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: how much automation can be done through these tools? How easy is it to grow that number? Scalability is a key feature for automation tools, as they’re expected to work unsupervised.</li>
<li><strong>User-friendliness</strong>: UX is an important aspect of any tool, especially so for mission-critical systems. The easier they are to set up and maintain, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Community support</strong>: an active community around a tool speaks volumes of the quality of that tool.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: any tool is worthless if it doesn’t have detailed and well-structured documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Security features</strong>: understanding how easy these tools make it for the operations team to set up a secure environment will dictate how safe they are (in the context of this article).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="categories-of-automation-tools">Categories of Automation Tools</h3>
<p>DevOps automation tools can be grouped into several categories, each addressing different aspects of the development process and operations lifecycle. Understanding these categories will help you identify which tools are best suited for your specific needs.</p>
<h4 id="1-continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment-cicd">1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h4>
<p>CI/CD tools are the backbone of modern DevOps practices. They automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. By streamlining these steps, CI/CD tools help ensure that code is consistently built, tested, and released with minimal manual intervention.</p>
<h4 id="2-configuration-management">2. Configuration Management</h4>
<p>Configuration management tools focus on maintaining consistency across your infrastructure. They automate the setup, deployment, and management of servers and applications, ensuring that environments remain stable and reproducible. This category is essential for managing large-scale deployments and minimizing configuration drift.</p>
<h4 id="3-infrastructure-as-code-iac">3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h4>
<p>IaC tools are all about infrastructure management and infrastructure automation. This approach enables version control for your infra, reproducibility for your environments, and scalability, making it easier to provision and manage resources across different environments.</p>
<h3 id="my-favorite-devops-automation-tools">My Favorite DevOps Automation Tools</h3>
<p>Alright, and before we go into the details of each tool, let me share my personal favorite ones.</p>
<p>While all the tools we’re about to discuss are fantastic in their own right, there are three that have truly won my nerd heart: <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>, <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong>, and <strong>Ansible</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> is like that all-in-one Swiss Army knife you didn’t know you needed—but now you can’t live without it. With a perfect <strong>5/5</strong> in Integration Capabilities, Scalability, User-Friendliness, and Community Support, it checks all the boxes effortlessly. I can’t remember how many times I’ve relied on it for setting up quick CI/CD pipelines with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> is my go-to for managing AWS resources. It scores <strong>5/5</strong> in Integration Capabilities, Scalability, and Security Features, making it indispensable for anyone deeply embedded in the AWS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Ansible</strong> takes the cake when it comes to configuration management and automation. With an outstanding <strong>5/5</strong> ratings across Integration Capabilities, Scalability, User-Friendliness, and Community Support, it’s no wonder Ansible is the go-to tool for so many other DevOps in the industry.</p>

<h3 id="implement-continuous-integration-and-deployment">Implement Continuous Integration and Deployment</h3>
<p>Whenever possible, code changes and the corresponding production deployment should be something that happens automatically with the least amount of human intervention possible.</p>
<p>This is because it’s such a critical task for any product, that it needs to be 100% reliable and efficient. In other words, it should always work, whether you do it once a week or 5 times on the same day, and it should always be performed as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This not only speeds up the development process but also ensures that any issues are detected and addressed promptly. CI tools usually offer the option of a rollback, in case something goes wrong. This is another key best practice, as errors will undoubtedly reach production, no matter how much we plan to avoid it, so it’s better to be prepared than to ignore the possibility and then have to manually perform rollbacks, or even worse, apply fixes directly in production.</p>
<h3 id="use-infrastructure-as-code-iac">Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
<p>Managing your infrastructure can be a daunting task for projects that have a complex architecture.</p>
<p>With IaC DevOps operators can manage the infra through code ensuring consistency across all environments.</p>
<p>Thanks to the “code” part of IaC, you can version control your infrastructure, making it easier to reproduce environments and roll back changes if needed.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-proper-monitoring-and-logging">Ensure Proper Monitoring and Logging</h3>
<p>Implement comprehensive monitoring solutions to keep an eye on your applications and infrastructure is a key DevOps automation practice.</p>
<p>After all, if you plan to improve, you need to measure, right?</p>
<p>In the same train of thought, effective logging helps you gain valuable insights and troubleshoot issues in your platform, ensuring your systems run smoothly for as long as possible.</p>
<h3 id="foster-a-culture-of-collaboration-and-continuous-improvement">Foster a Culture of Collaboration and Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Break with the idea that developers and operations should not work together side-by-side, and instead encourage open communication between both teams.</p>
<p>Promote a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, where teams regularly review and improve their processes based on feedback and new insights.</p>
<h3 id="integrate-security-into-the-automation-process-devsecops">Integrate Security into the Automation Process (DevSecOps)</h3>
<p>Security should be an integral part of your DevOps pipeline and adding automation tools into the mix should not affect that.</p>
<p>Make sure to embed security practices within your DevOps automation processes and automate security testing and compliance checks to ensure that your applications are secure from the ground up.</p>
<h3 id="address-and-eliminate-toil">Address and Eliminate Toil</h3>
<p>Toil refers to repetitive, manual tasks that do not provide lasting value, for instance: performing manual deployments after each sprint.</p>
<p>Imagine your development team needs to deploy a new version of your web application every week. Each deployment involves several repetitive steps, like logging into the server, copying the files, configuring the server, restarting all services and checking if everything went right.</p>
<p>While you might consider production deployments to be very valuable, the truth is that if you have to do it every week, then the <strong>lasting</strong> value is non-existent.</p>
<p>Try to identify sources of toil in your workflows and continuously work to reduce or eliminate them through automation.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-devops-automation-tools">Choose your DevOps automation tools</h2>

<h2 id="devops-key-best-practices">DevOps key best practices</h2>
<p>Here are 14 key best practices and methods for implementing DevOps:</p>
<h3 id="1-embrace-a-culture-of-collaboration-and-communication">1. Embrace a culture of collaboration and communication</h3>
<p>Collaboration and communication are central to the success of DevOps lifecycle. You need to encourage your team to continuously take ownership of their tasks and communicate (verbal and written) effectively between the development teams, operations teams, quality assurance teams, and other related stakeholders.</p>
<p>View mistakes and failures as learning opportunities rather than assigning blame. You and your team should hold postmortems to identify the root causes of incidents and develop strategies to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<h3 id="2-continuously-seek-feedback">2. Continuously seek feedback</h3>
<p>Continuously engage your users, stakeholders, and team members to get feedback on their overall experience of the application. This feedback helps resolve issues, shape your application release cycle, and guarantee you’re building with users in mind. As noted in the latest <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/devops/state-of-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">State of DevOps Report</a>, “<em>Teams that focus on the user</em> <em>experience</em> <em>have 40% higher organizational performance than t**hose</em> <em>that don’t</em>.”</p>
<p>Internally, your team can also benefit from continuous feedback during code reviews. By involving stakeholders in analyzing code quality, identifying issues, and suggesting improvements, you can create a culture of constant improvement.</p>
<h3 id="3-adopt-continuous-integration">3. Adopt continuous integration</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice in which developers regularly commit their code changes into a shared repository, which might happen multiple times a day. The goal of CI is to provide feedback quickly to developers so that they can identify and fix defects early in the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The CI process involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated builds</strong>: When you commit a code into a shared repository, it triggers an automatic build to verify that the code integrates well with the existing project.</li>
<li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: After the build is successful, automated tests are run to validate that the changes committed don’t break the application.
<img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/ci-process-07zce.png" alt="CI Process"></li>
</ul>
<p>To support your application in following the CI process and delivering the best value, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commit small and incremental changes to the shared repository often.</li>
<li>Automate the build process so every commit results in a reliable and repeated build.</li>
<li>Set up a test to run with every commit to catch any issues as soon as they are introduced.</li>
<li>Fix broken builds immediately.</li>
<li>Use a version control system like Git to manage deployment, branches, and track commits.</li>
<li>Document how the CI process works and how to resolve common issues like broken builds. This will help your team work faster and onboard new members easily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-practice-continuous-delivery">4. Practice continuous delivery</h3>
<p>Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering practice where code changes are automatically prepared for release to production. It extends the CI process by ensuring that the codebase that has been added, tested, and passed is ready for release into the staging or production environment.</p>
<p>The goal of CD is to automate the release pipeline so that new features, bug fixes, and improvements can be deployed to production at any time without manual intervention.</p>
<p>To implement CD effectively into your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the entire deployment pipeline (from testing to deployment) to minimize manual error, reduce deployment time, and maintain consistency across environments.</li>
<li>Use Git as a source of truth for development and infrastructure management.</li>
<li>Track the health of your application by monitoring performance, errors, and logging.</li>
<li>Set up your pipeline so it can revert to previous working deployments in case of critical error.</li>
<li>Use feature flags to roll out features gradually into production.</li>
<li>Integrate security measures into your pipeline to scan and check for vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-embrace-infrastructure-as-code-iac">5. Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a DevOps practice that uses machine-readable definition files to manage and provision computing infrastructure rather than physical hardware configuration or direct interaction with configuration tools. It involves using code (JSON, XML, or domain-specific languages) to specify and configure providers, resources, and more.</p>
<p>IaC aims to eliminate manual workflow in provisioning resources, making deployment faster and less prone to human errors. To implement IaC effectively into your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Git to collaborate, track changes over time, and easily roll back to previous changes over version if necessary.</li>
<li>Break down your infrastructure code into reusable components. This makes it easy to manage and reuse across multiple projects.</li>
<li>Write unit tests, integration tests, and other security-related tests to validate that IaC works as designed.</li>
<li>Use environment variables to manage sensitive values like API ket, resource IDs, and more.</li>
<li>Use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to integrate IaC into your pipeline to automatically provision or update infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recently concluded <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/devops/state-of-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">State of DevOps Report</a> also highlights the importance of IaC for its elasticity, on-demand resource provisioning, and flexibility. These advantages have contributed to a 30% higher organizational performance compared to those not utilizing IaC.</p>
<h3 id="6-adopt-microservices-architecture">6. Adopt microservices architecture</h3>
<p>Microservice architecture involves breaking down your application into small, independent, and deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be independently developed, tested, and deployed. This architecture promotes scalability, fault isolation, and rapid innovation, which are essential to the DevOps environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/microservices-architecture-wo59y.png" alt="Microservices Architecture"></p>
<p>To implement microservice architecture effectively into your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design your microservice to have retries, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms to handle failure gracefully.</li>
<li>Build your microservice to manage its database or data source to avoid tight coupling.</li>
<li>Use containerization and orchestration tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to manage deployment.</li>
<li>Implement CI/CD pipeline to enable reliable and consistent updates to individual services.</li>
<li>Use message brokers like Kafka and RabbitMQ to communicate between services and reduce dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, a microservice architecture is only suitable for mature systems with multiple intertwined parts built for scale rather than a relatively small software that could be run better as a mon</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="7-use-version-control-for-everything">7. Use version control for everything</h3>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to files over time. It lets you track, manage, and collaborate on code efficiently. To use Git effectively in your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use effective branching strategies like feature branching and Git flow to manage the development process.</li>
<li>Promote frequent commits with descriptive commit messages.</li>
<li>Use pull requests (PRs) to facilitate code review and collaboration between the development and operations teams.</li>
<li>Keep your repositories clean of generated files like binaries, logs, or dependencies.</li>
<li>Use tag releases to mark important milestones, e.g., <code>v1.0.2</code>.</li>
<li>Use descriptive branch names. This will help you and your team understand the purpose of each branch.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/version-control-6i5g0.png" alt="Version control"></p>
<h3 id="8-practice-continuous-monitoring-and-observability">8. Practice continuous monitoring and observability</h3>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong> involves collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data from your system in real-time to detect issues like outages, bottlenecks, or resource exhaustion. On the other hand, <strong>Observability</strong> is about understanding what is happening inside the system by analyzing data like logs, metrics, and traces. To take advantage of monitoring and observability in your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and other performance-related metrics to clarify performance and ensure proper monitoring coverage.</li>
<li>Monitor key metrics like uptime, error rates, latency, and CPU usage.</li>
<li>Use tools like Grafana and Kibana to create real-time visual dashboards that can give you insights on how your application is performing.</li>
<li>Collect all your internal data (logs, metrics, and traces) in a centralized location for easy access and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-adopt-configuration-management">9. Adopt configuration management</h3>
<p>Configuration management is the process of systematically handling changes to a system’s configuration to ensure consistency and integrity. It involves defining and maintaining settings, dependencies, and states of servers, network devices, applications, and databases. The goal is to make sure infrastructure is configured correctly, and changes are managed effectively to avoid errors and downtime.</p>
<p>To take advantage of configuration management in your DevOps processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the entire configuration process, from setting up applications and services to deployment of servers.</li>
<li>Use Git to manage and store your configurations centrally. This makes it easy to track changes, collaborate, and roll back if needed.</li>
<li>Write modular configuration files that can be reused across different environments.</li>
<li>Document all your configurations so that your team members can understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-practice-devsecops">10. Practice DevSecOps</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devsecops-rafjn.png" alt="DevSecOps"></p>
<p>DevSecOps stands for <strong>Development, Security, and Operations</strong>. It’s an extension of DevOps that promotes the integration of security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). In the traditional development process, security is often handled by a separate team at the end of the process. In this case, when vulnerabilities are discovered, it slows down the deployment and increases the cost of fixing issues.</p>
<p>To prevent such incidents in your DevOps processes, integrate security practices and tools into all stages of your SDLC to avoid downtime and fix vulnerabilities early.</p>
<h3 id="11-choose-the-right-devops-tools">11. Choose the right DevOps tools</h3>
<p>Selecting the right DevOps tools can significantly impact the success of your DevOps processes. The ecosystem is constantly changing, and you’ll get varying opinions on tools to use; it’s important to carefully evaluate options. Consider your team’s strengths, the learning curve, and your organization’s goal before adopting any tool for your DevOps pipeline.</p>
<p>Below are some tools you should consider when implementing DevOps processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CI/CD tools</strong>: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Azure Pipeline, and GitHub Actions help automate the integration and deployment of code changes.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools</strong>: Tools like Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi, Chef, AWS CloudFormation, and Vagrant help automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Containerization and orchestration tools</strong>: Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker Swarm, and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) help manage and orchestrate containers at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and logging tools</strong>: Tools like Prometheus, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), Datadog, Splunk, and Grafana help track system performance, logging, and alerting.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration management tools</strong>: Tools like Chef, Puppet, CFEngine, SaltStack, and Ansible help ensure system configurations remain consistent across environments.</li>
<li><strong>Security and compliance tools</strong>: Tools like HashiCorp Vault, OWASP ZAP, Snyk, SonarQube, and Aqua Security help enforce security policies, perform scans, and conduct compliance checks.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration and communication tools</strong>: Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Trello, Jira, and Confluence help facilitate communication and collaboration between teams.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-balance-quality-and-speed">12. Balance quality and speed</h3>
<p>A key promise of DevOps is that it delivers software quickly. While it’s tempting to speed up development processes, this often leads to reduced quality and potential security vulnerabilities. The pressure is further heightened because a lot of metrics in DevOps are based on how fast your system is, making it even more tempting to prioritize fast delivery over quality.</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, strike a balance between quality and speed by taking the time to test the application before release. Below are some strategies to help maintain this balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement continuous testing into your CI/CD pipeline to catch bugs early.</li>
<li>Encourage a culture of quality that makes developers take full ownership of their code.</li>
<li>Define quality checkpoints like code reviews, tests, and coding standards that must be passed before moving to production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-use-feature-flags-to-manage-features">13. Use feature flags to manage features</h3>
<p>Feature flags (also known as Feature Toggles) are powerful tools that let you enable or disable specific features in an application without deploying new code. They provide fine-grain control over the parts of an application that are visible and active at any time.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/feature-flags-7unnx.png" alt="Feature flags"></p>
<p>You can use a feature flag in your DevOps processes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform gradual feature rollout.</li>
<li>Safely deploy features and rollback if needed.</li>
<li>Perform A/B testing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-adopt-agile-project-management">14. Adopt agile project management</h3>
<p>Agile software development methodologies like Scrum and Kanban are well-suited to the iterative nature of DevOps. Agile uses a continuous approach to develop software rather than the linear waterfall model.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/agile-project-management-1pjcq.png" alt="Agile VS Waterfall"></p>
<p>By embracing agile project management, you manage your projects better by breaking them down into smaller and manageable chunks rather than dealing with them in large chunks that are prone to error.</p>
<h2 id="devops-anti-patterns-to-avoid">DevOps anti-patterns to avoid</h2>
<p>While DevOps has become the go-to approach for delivering scalable and robust applications, it has also introduced certain anti-patterns that can prevent you from fully reaping its benefits. These anti-patterns can lead to inefficiencies, limit collaboration, and result in poor outcomes. Let’s look at some common anti-patterns you should avoid:</p>
<p><strong>Automating everything without understanding</strong>
Because automation is at the center of DevOps, teams often fall into the trap of automating every process without understanding the underlying workflow or business logic. This can lead to incorrect implementation, inefficient processes, complexities, and sometimes bugs.</p>
<p>Before you automate a process, make sure you understand the underlying workflow. Start with critical processes that provide the most value, and regularly review automated processes to confirm they are providing value.</p>
<p><strong>DevOps as a one-time project</strong>
When most teams build or extend a project, timelines are usually attached. They have start and end dates for product design, engineering, <strong>DevOps</strong>, QA, and more, which may cause them to view DevOps as a short-term project. This prevents teams from realizing the long-term benefits and leads to a lack of continuous improvement.</p>
<p>You need to adopt DevOps as a continuous practice by regularly evaluating processes and workflow and encouraging your team to experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Not having a proper monitoring and feedback loop</strong>
Failing to implement adequate monitoring and feedback mechanisms to track application performance, reliability, and user experience makes it difficult for the DevOps team to detect issues in real-time. This can lead to longer recovery time when there’s an issue, and the team may miss opportunities to learn and improve the system.</p>
<p>To address this, you need to implement end-to-end monitoring and observability tools to gain insight into the system’s health. Additionally, a clear feedback loop should be established so that responsible teams are notified promptly when issues are detected.</p>
<p><strong>Siloed DevOps team</strong>
A common practice in most organizations is to separate the DevOps Team from other teams and task them with all DevOps activities. This separation defeats the core principle of DevOps: cross-functional collaboration and shared ownership. It isolates the DevOps team from others, leading to communication gaps and a lack of ownership.</p>
<p>To address this, promote a DevOps culture of shared responsibility where DevOps practices are adopted across all teams.</p>
<p><strong>Over-reliance on tools</strong>
Adopting the latest and trendiest DevOps tool doesn’t guarantee success. Sometimes, they even increase the problems if not used correctly. DevOps is about processes, people, and tools.</p>
<p>To address this, follow the right processes: ensure effective team collaboration, improve workflows and align with the teams before choosing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Too many feature flags</strong>
While feature flags are powerful, too many can lead to technical debt, making the codebase messy, cluttered, and difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>To address this, use feature flags as needed and regularly clean up flags that are no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>Overcomplicating the CI/CD pipeline</strong>
When pipelines are overly complicated with multi-step CI/CD, stages, and checks, it leads to slow deployments. This can slow down the releases, become a bottleneck, and make troubleshooting difficult.</p>
<p>You can address this by keeping the pipeline simple and focusing on key steps like build, test, and deploy. Then, add stages only when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Not defining what success looks like</strong>
Failing to define and track meaningful metrics can make it difficult to measure the success or failure of DevOps practices. Without clear metrics, the team may not know if they are improving, and the team leads may struggle to justify the investment in DevOps to management.</p>
<p>You can address this by defining a key performance index (KPI) that aligns with your business goal, such as deployment frequency, change lead time, and mean time to recovery (MTTR).</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key takeaway</h2>
<p>DevOps best practices are essential for improving your software development and operations processes. These practices help improve your workflows, enhance collaboration, manage resources better, and ensure the delivery of high-quality software.</p>
<p>Additionally, you need to be aware of anti-patterns and pitfalls that can hinder the success of your DevOps implementation by avoiding common patterns like creating silos or overcomplicating your pipelines.</p>

<p>DevOps has evolved over the last decade. Today, it is more than automating tasks and having engineers write scripts. It is now more about practices that can help to automate software delivery, improve business and the overall software development processes.</p>
<p>Certain trends are impacting the DevOps market currently and will also play a role in the future of DevOps. Some of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Cloud technology</li>
<li>Automation and CI/CD</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at these trends and how they indirectly influence your decision.</p>
<h3 id="microservices">Microservices</h3>
<p>This architecture enables the agile development and continuous delivery of software solutions. In a microservice architecture, applications are split into smaller parts known as microservices that focus on a single responsibility. Each part (microservice) is developed and deployed independently, and microservices communicate via events or API interfaces.</p>
<p>It is a common trend, and many organizations are adopting this architecture because of its benefits, one of which is adapting to market changes and shipping out features faster rather than the delays of modular monoliths. A DevOps engineer is critical to helping in the adoption and success of microservices.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-technology">Cloud technology</h3>
<p>Cloud-native applications have become popular recently. They involve developing and deploying software applications and their dependencies in a cloud environment.</p>
<p>There are several cloud platforms, some of the most popular ones being <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">AWS</a>, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). One advantage of using these cloud providers is that you don’t have to manage the cloud infrastructure but instead focus on developing your applications. You also pay for only the resources you use.</p>
<p>Containerization tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> have been made popular by cloud services and microservices. These <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">tools for DevOps engineers</a> are an important part of their toolkit.</p>
<h3 id="automation-and-cicd">Automation and CI/CD</h3>
<p>Automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment are integral to DevOps. Organizations are widely adopting automation of their infrastructure and deployments because of its benefits including faster and more reliable application deployments.</p>
<p>Also, with the adoption of GitOps, an operational framework that takes DevOps principles and best practices for application development and applies them to infrastructure automation, the deployment process is even more efficient. DevOps professionals are the major catalysts for this and will remain relevant.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning">Artificial intelligence and machine learning</h3>
<p>AI and ML have become integrated into our daily lives and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation-tools" target="_blank">automation tools</a> are used to automate processes and routine tasks, monitor system health, and predict potential system issues. These AI tools need to be designed, maintained, and enhanced.</p>
<p>In the AI and ML field, it is the job of an MLOps engineer, but a DevOps engineer can upskill and switch roles to an MLOps engineer.</p>
<p>There is a concern that AI will replace DevOps professionals. However, I believe AI will complement the DevOps process, improve the software development lifecycle, and make better DevOps engineers.</p>

<li>Continuous testing</li>
<li>Continuous deployment (CD)</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring</li>
<li>Continuous feedback</li>
<li>Continuous operations</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at the DevOps lifecycle in detail.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-devops-lifecycle">What is the DevOps lifecycle?</h2>
<p>DevOps lifecycle is a set of stages that software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams use to deliver software applications in an efficient and reliable manner. It is a continuous and iterative process that facilitates integration and collaboration between these teams.</p>
<p>In traditional software development, developers don’t just build and deploy applications. They must also accommodate changes, fix bugs, consider feature requests, and handle various administrative tasks. The same approach to continuous improvement applies in DevOps, which has led to industries adopting DevOps to factor in the lifecycle processes into their operations.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the DevOps lifecycle is to streamline your development and delivery process and ensure applications are reliable and efficiently deployed.</p>
<p>It follows a range of continuous development, integration, testing, monitoring, and feedback gathering, with each section using sets of best practices and tools to ensure the overall project goal.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/7-key-phases-of-the-devops-lifecycle-4zoj6.png" alt="DevOps Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="7-key-phases-of-the-devops-lifecycle">7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle</h2>
<p>The 7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle, also known as the 7 C’s of DevOps, are sets of interconnected stages that work together in a continuous loop to help you develop, test, and deploy applications quickly. Below are the key phases of the DevOps lifecycle:</p>
<h3 id="1-continuous-development">1. Continuous development</h3>
<p>This phase is about planning and coding the software application. Developers plan the software and break the entire development process into smaller cycles that add value to the overall software development goal.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-development-xbxj3.png" alt="Continuous Development"></p>
<p>By following this process, DevOps teams can easily map out the <strong>software development lifecycle (SLDC)</strong> to other stakeholders regarding expectations, responsibilities, and timelines. Additionally, because the development teams, testers, and other stakeholders build software piece-by-piece, the development process is fast, large-scale risk is minimal, and the process can easily adapt to changing requirements and business needs.</p>
<p><strong>Tools used for continuous development</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning:</strong> DevOps teams use project management tools like Jira, Linear, and ClickUp to help teams plan, track, and release software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding</strong>: DevOps teams can use version control systems like Git, editors like Visual Studio Code, and pair programming tools like Tuple to effectively collaborate with other development teams when building software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-continuous-integration-ci">2. Continuous integration (CI)</h3>
<p>After writing the code and storing it in a shared repository, DevOps teams can set up a CI pipeline on the repository so that when developers commit changes to the source code, they can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect changes to existing code and initiate actions like unit testing, integration testing, and the build process.</li>
<li>Perform code quality analysis.</li>
<li>Generate deployment artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-integration-b4lef.png" alt="Continuous Integration"></p>
<p>This is particularly important because the development team will continue to push updates into the source code to build new features, fix bugs, perform code improvement, and refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>
<p>Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions are some <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation-tools" target="_blank">automation tools</a> DevOps teams use to build, test, and deploy code changes.</p>
<h3 id="3-continuous-testing">3. Continuous testing</h3>
<p>Continuous testing involves automating tests on the developed code to ensure that changes are validated at each step of the development cycle, catch defects, and provide feedback without the need for human intervention.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-testing-d90gb.png" alt="Continuous testing"></p>
<p>If an error or bug occurs, the code is returned to the previous phase (integration) for correction and possible fixes. Automated testing improves the overall workflow by saving time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>
<p>Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber are some automation testing tools that DevOps teams use to automate testing at scale.</p>
<h3 id="4-continuous-deployment-cd">4. Continuous deployment (CD)</h3>
<p>This is the phase when the codes that have passed all tests are automatically deployed to the staging or production environment. Continuous deployment’s overall goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the time between development and deployment.</li>
<li>Facilitate the deployment of finished code to production servers.</li>
<li>Ensure consistency across development, testing, staging, and production environments.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-deployment-bprfv.png" alt="Continuous Deployment"></p>
<p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration tools</strong>: The DevOps team uses configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack to automate the provisioning, configuration, management, and continuous delivery of IT infrastructure. These tools help the DevOps team increase efficiency, maintain consistency across environments, and reduce errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Containerization and orchestration tools</strong>: The DevOps team uses tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a>, Vagrant, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to build and test applications. These tools help applications respond to demand (scaling up and scaling down) and maintain consistency across environments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-continuous-monitoring">5. Continuous monitoring</h3>
<p>This is the phase where you keep an eye on the deployed application to monitor performance, security, and other helpful data. It involves the collection of metrics and other application usage-related data to detect issues such as system errors, server downtime, application errors, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it involves collaboration with the operation teams to monitor bugs and identify improper system behavior.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-monitoring-cydj0.png" alt="Continuous Monitoring"></p>
<p>Continuous monitoring improves the productivity and reliability of the system while reducing IT support costs. Any issues detected during this phase can be promptly reported and addressed in the continuous development phase, creating a more efficient feedback loop.</p>
<p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>
<p>Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Datadog are some tools DevOps teams use to continuously monitor the application and infrastructure to identify and resolve issues.</p>
<h3 id="6-continuous-feedback">6. Continuous feedback</h3>
<p>Continuous feedback is about gathering information from users and stakeholders to understand how the software performs in real-life scenarios. The feedback is then continuously analyzed and used to make informed decisions and improve the overall development process.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-feedback-eg1tr.png" alt="Feedback"></p>
<p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>
<p>DevOps teams use tools like Datadog and LogRocket to gather and gain insights into how users interact with their products.</p>
<h3 id="7-continuous-operations">7. Continuous operations</h3>
<p>In the traditional software development process, developers might need to pull down the server when they want to update and maintain applications. This approach disrupts the development process, potentially increases organizational costs, and can lead to user service interruptions.</p>

<h2 id="essential-devops-lifecycle-best-practices">Essential DevOps lifecycle best practices</h2>
<p>An essential part of DevOps culture is the lifecycle phases. While the lifecycle phases streamline the operational process and help you build reliable software, there are still some gotchas that you need to consider when integrating this process into your SDLC. Below are some best practices you should consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Promote collaboration</strong>: As a DevOps engineer, you need to encourage cross-functional collaboration and shared responsibilities among direct teams and other stakeholders. This will help you and your team avoid the traditional siloed approach, break communication barriers, and promote DevOps culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show empathy and support</strong>: Implementing DevOps lifecycle into your development process may take time and require some adjustment for you and your team members. You need to support the team with resources and any helpful training material to help facilitate the process. Most importantly, allow time for everyone to adapt to the new process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set metrics or milestones</strong>: As the popular saying goes, <strong>“You can’t manage what you can’t measure</strong>**.****”** You must set clear objectives and define performance metrics at the beginning or during the adoption of a new process. This will help you and your team know what success looks like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invest in tools</strong>: At the heart of DevOps are the toolchains that automate toils and enable easy collaboration between development and operations teams. You should invest in DevOps tools that your team needs to automate their DevOps workflow. Below are some DevOps tools that can help you automate processes:</p>

<p>If you truly want to understand what makes DevOps so effective, it’s essential to know and master its core principles.</p>
<p>DevOps is more than just a collaboration between development and operations teams; it’s built on fundamental principles that simplify software delivery.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to dive deep into the core principles and practices that make the DevOps practice “tick.”	If you’re a DevOps engineer or you want to become one, these are the DevOps principles you should master.</p>
<p>I’ll explain the following principles in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the culture you want to join</li>
<li>CI/CD</li>
<li>Knowing how to use infrastructure as code tools.</li>
<li>Understanding containerization.</li>
<li>Monitoring &#x26; observability.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="1-understanding-devops-culture">1. Understanding DevOps Culture</h2>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> culture is the foundation for all DevOps principles. At its core, it’s about fostering a collaborative environment where development and operations teams work together seamlessly. In traditional software development, developers focus on writing code while the operations team is tasked with deploying and maintaining it. This division often leads to misunderstandings and delays.</p>
<p>Instead of operating in silos, these teams, when they follow the DevOps culture, end up sharing a common goal: delivering high-quality software efficiently. This cultural shift reduces the “us versus them” mentality that many organizations suffer, fostering cooperation instead of blame.</p>
<p>DevOps culture encourages development and operations to collaborate throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). By aligning their goals and encouraging open communication, both teams can work together to improve the process of development, ultimately resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery.</p>
<p>Key components of this culture include shared responsibility, transparency, and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
<h2 id="2-continuous-integration-and-continuous-deployment-cicd">2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continous-development-vs-continuous-integration-l2fak.png" alt="Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment"></p>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are central to DevOps principles. CI is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, ensuring that new code is <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/test-automation" target="_blank">automatically tested</a> and validated. This practice helps catch bugs early, reducing the risk of introducing issues into the main codebase. CI allows devs and ops teams to work more efficiently, improving the overall quality of the software.</p>
<p>Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, takes things a step further by automatically deploying code changes to production once they pass the CI tests. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered to users as quickly as possible. Together, CI and CD form a pipeline that streamlines the software development lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment in seconds (or in some cases, minutes).</p>
<p>Implementing CI/CD involves using various tools and practices. Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and Travis CI are popular options for setting up CI pipelines, while tools like Spinnaker and Argo CD help with CD.</p>
<h2 id="3-infrastructure-as-code-iac">3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-w965a.png" alt="Infrastructure as Code"></p>
<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a game-changer in the DevOps world. Traditionally, provisioning infrastructure involved manual setup and configuration, which was time-consuming and, of course, prone to human error. IaC changes the game by treating infrastructure the same way we treat application code: as a set of scripts or configurations that can be version-controlled, tested, and automated.</p>
<p>Through IaC, DevOps teams can ensure consistency and repeatability across different environments. It eliminates the “works on my machine” problem by providing a standardized environment for software to run on, whether it’s on a developer’s local machine, in a staging environment, or in production.</p>
<p>Over the years, IaC tools have evolved quite a lot. At the start of it all, players like Chef and Puppet introduced the concept of configuration management, allowing you to define the desired state of your systems. Ansible took that one step further with its agentless architecture, making it easier to manage infrastructure at scale. Terraform took IaC to the next level by providing a tool-agnostic way to provision resources across multiple cloud providers, making it a favorite among DevOps engineers.</p>
<h2 id="4-containerization">4. Containerization</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/containers-docker-g491z.png" alt="Containerization"></p>
<p>Containerization is a core practice and one of the main devops principles to constantly apply. Containers provide a lightweight, portable way to package software along with its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. Containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start up than virtual machines.</p>
<p>These “containers” have been playing a key role in solving one of the age-old problems in software development: environment inconsistencies. By encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container, you can ensure that it runs the same way on a developer’s laptop as it does in production. This consistency simplifies the development process and reduces the risk of environment-related problems.</p>
<p>In this space, Docker is the most popular tool for creating and managing containers (although not the only one), offering a simple way to build, package, and distribute containerized applications. Kubernetes takes containerization to the next level by providing a platform for orchestrating containers at scale. With Kubernetes, you can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it easier to manage complex, multi-container applications.</p>
<p>While there is no excuse to not use DevOps at this stage in any software project, some of the biggest benefits of using containers in the DevOps lifecycle are: consistency, scalability, and portability.</p>
<p>In other words, they make it easier to move applications between different environments. They also enable more efficient use of resources, as multiple containers can run on the same host without the overhead of a full virtual machine.</p>
<h2 id="5-monitoring-and-observability">5. Monitoring and Observability</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/monitoring-servers-14k80.png" alt="Monitoring and Observability"></p>
<p>Monitoring and observability are essential components of the DevOps practice and key principles for any DevOps team. While monitoring focuses on tracking the health and performance of your systems, observability goes a step further by providing insights into the internal state of your applications based on the data they produce. Together, they enable DevOps teams to detect and troubleshoot issues quickly, ensuring that applications run smoothly.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring involves constantly tracking key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana) are popular choices for collecting and visualizing this data. All public cloud providers also have their own solutions, in some cases even based on the open-source versions mentioned before.</p>
<p>Whatever the tool of your choice is, they all provide real-time insights into the performance of your applications and infrastructure, helping you identify potential issues before they impact users.</p>
<p>Now the practice of observability extends beyond monitoring by providing a deeper understanding of how your systems are behaving. It involves collecting and analyzing logs, metrics and traces to gain insights into the root cause of issues. OpenTelemetry, for instance, is an emerging standard for collecting telemetry data, offering a unified way to instrument, collect, and export data for analysis. This standardization makes it easier to integrate observability into your DevOps practices, regardless of the tools you’re using.</p>
<h2 id="6-security-in-devops">6. Security in DevOps</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/secured-servers-amsed.png" alt="Security in DevOps"></p>
<p>Security is a critical aspect of the DevOps lifecycle, and it’s something that needs to be integrated from the very beginning of any project expected to see the light of production at one point.</p>
<p>DevSecOps is the practice of embedding security into the DevOps pipeline, ensuring that security measures are applied consistently throughout the software development lifecycle (reviewing code for vulnerabilities, checking IaC scripts, etc). Through this practice, DevOps helps catch vulnerabilities early and greatly reduce the risk of security breaches in production.</p>
<p>Sadly, in many companies and teams that follow more traditional practices, security tends to be an afterthought, gaining importance only after the code is written and deployed. This approach can lead to costly and time-consuming fixes. DevSecOps, on the other hand, integrates security into every stage of the development and operations process, from code development to deployment. In the end, this helps security teams to automate security testing, identify vulnerabilities early, and enforce security policies consistently. All without having to read a single line of code themselves.</p>
<p>In this space, tools like Snyk, Aqua Security, and HashiCorp Vault are king and they can help you integrate security into your DevOps workflows.</p>
<h2 id="7-reducing-toil-and-technical-debt">7. Reducing Toil and Technical Debt</h2>
<p>Toil and technical debt are two of the biggest productivity killers in software development. Toil refers to the repetitive, manual tasks that don’t add direct value to the product, while technical debt is the accumulation of shortcuts and workarounds that make the codebase harder to maintain over time. Both can slow down your development workflow and make it more challenging to deliver new features.</p>
<p>And because of that, one of the big and important DevOps principles is to aim to reduce both. Yes, DevOps teams can also help reduce technical debt.</p>
<p>Reducing toil involves automating repetitive tasks to free up time for more valuable work. Tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet can help automate infrastructure management, while CI/CD pipelines can automate the build, test, and deployment processes. In the end, less manual work translates to reducing the chances of errors and giving team members the chance to focus on more interesting and strategic tasks.</p>
<p>Technical debt, on the other hand, requires a proactive approach to address. It’s about finding the right balance between delivering new features and maintaining the quality of the codebase. Regularly refactoring code, improving documentation, and addressing known issues can help keep technical debt in check. Of course, this also needs to be balanced with their ability to deliver new features and move the product forward.</p>
<h2 id="8-gitops-the-future-of-deployment">8. GitOps: The Future of Deployment</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/git-ops-tmggz.png" alt="GitOps"></p>
<p>GitOps is a new practice that takes the principles of Git and applies them to operations. It’s about using Git as the single source of truth for your infrastructure and application configurations. By storing everything in Git, you can use version control to manage changes, track history, and facilitate collaboration among development and operations teams.</p>
<p>You essentially version your entire infrastructure with the same tools you version your code.</p>
<p>In other words, all changes to the infrastructure and applications are made through pull requests to the Git repository. Once a change is merged, an automated process applies the change to the target environment. This approach provides a consistent, auditable, and repeatable way to manage deployments, making it easier to maintain the desired state of your systems.</p>
<p>Through GitOps, teams can manage deployments and gain the following benefits: improved visibility, version control, and traceability.</p>
<p>This methodology aligns well with the DevOps principles of automation, consistency, and collaboration, making it easier to manage complex deployments at scale.</p>
<p>Key tools for implementing GitOps include Argo CD and Flux. These tools help you automate the deployment process by monitoring the Git repository for changes and applying them to the cluster.</p>
<h2 id="9-continuous-learning-and-improvement">9. Continuous Learning and Improvement</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/learn-improve-4fzcr.png" alt="Continuous Learning and Improvement"></p>
<p>In general the world of tech is constantly evolving and changing and continuous learning and improvement are essential practices for staying ahead and relevant.</p>
<p>That said, in the DevOps landscape change is also a constant, with new tools, practices, and technologies emerging all the time. If you think about it, before 2006 we didn’t even have containers.</p>
<p>So to keep up, DevOps engineers and teams need to be committed to learning and improving continuously.</p>
<p>Encouraging a culture of continuous learning within your team can help keep everyone up-to-date with the latest DevOps trends and tools. This can include participating in conferences, attending workshops, and enrolling in online courses. Reading books like “The Phoenix Project,” “The Unicorn Project,” and “The DevOps Handbook” can provide valuable insights and inspiration.</p>
<p>If you’re not into books, then websites like <a href="http://12factor.net" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">12factor.net</a>, <a href="http://OpenGitOps.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenGitOps.dev</a>, and <a href="http://CNCF.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF.io</a> are also great resources for staying current with industry <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/best-practices" target="_blank">best practices</a>.</p>
<p>Continuous improvement goes hand-in-hand with continuous learning. It’s about regularly reviewing and refining your processes, identifying areas for improvement after failing and experimenting with new approaches. This iterative approach helps you optimize the development process, improve collaboration between devs and operations, and deliver better software.</p>
<h2 id="10-understanding-programming-concepts">10. Understanding Programming Concepts</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/code-sample-fjblw.png" alt="Understanding Programming Concepts"></p>
<p>While not every DevOps engineer needs to be a full-fledged developer, having a solid understanding of programming concepts is key to success in the professional world.</p>
<p>A good grasp of programming helps bridge the gap between development and operations, making it easier to collaborate and understand each other’s needs. Which, if you think about it, is literally the core principle of the DevOps practice.</p>
<p>Understanding programming translates to being able to write scripts in languages like Bash, Python, or PowerShell to automate tasks, manage infrastructure, and interact with APIs. This can range from simple tasks like automating server setup to more complex operations like orchestrating CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>Understanding programming concepts also enables you to better manage the software development lifecycle. It helps you understand how code changes affect system performance, security, and stability. This insight allows you to make more informed decisions when designing and implementing infrastructure and deployment processes.</p>
<h2 id="11-automation-in-devops">11. Automation in DevOps</h2>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">Automation</a> is at the heart of DevOps principles. It’s about automating repetitive and manual tasks to accelerate processes, reduce errors, and free up time for more strategic work. We partially covered this concept before as part of the toil reduction principle.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to explain that automation not only involves code builds and tests, it also includes infrastructure provisioning and application deployment. In other words,  automation plays a key role in every stage of the DevOps lifecycle.</p>
<p>The whole point of automation is to accelerate processes. It enables faster, more consistent, and more reliable software delivery. By automating tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment, you can reduce the time it takes to get new features into production and minimize the risk of human error.</p>
<p>There are many areas in the DevOps lifecycle where automation can be applied, in fact, the challenge would be to find areas where it wouldn’t make sense to apply it. These include CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, monitoring, and security testing. In this area, some of the most popular <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">DevOps tools</a> are Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and Selenium. They all provide the building blocks for automating these tasks, allowing you to create a seamless and efficient development workflow that everyone enjoys.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to start implementing automation in your DevOps workflow, consider starting small and gradually expanding automation efforts, using version control for automation scripts (Git is a great option), and continuously monitoring and refining automated processes.</p>
<p>It’s important to find a balance between automation and human intervention, ensuring that automation enhances the development workflow without introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Why is there so much debate about testing methodologies if DevOps is about streamlining software delivery? Why do we still encounter approaches like shift-left, shift-right, and even shift-down testing? Shouldn’t there be one universally accepted strategy?</p>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> emphasizes rapid development cycles, continuous integration, and delivery, but your projects or teams may have different needs, goals, or challenges. Factors like the <strong>type of application, infrastructure, team size, legacy systems</strong>, and <strong>release schedules</strong> can lead you to choose different testing strategies.</p>
<p>Despite these varying needs and challenges, DevOps recommends shift-left testing principles because it addresses the core problem of catching issues early. By integrating tests early, issues are resolved quickly before they become more costly and complex to fix.</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll learn what Shift-Left testing is, its benefits, things to consider, and best practices when implementing it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-shift-left-testing">What is Shift-Left testing?</h2>
<p>Shift-Left testing is a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/principles" target="_blank">principle in DevOps</a> that involves incorporating quality assurance and other testing activities <strong>earlier</strong> in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>Over the years, testing has been somewhat considered an afterthought of the development process. The traditional approach waits for the development cycle to end or at least waits until 50% of the development process is done before testing the application. This approach can be slow, costly, and does not maximize resources because bugs found during the tests can’t be easily fixed during the development cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/shift-left-testing-devops-3cr7m.png" alt="Shift-Left testing"></p>
<p>The main idea is to move testing to the <strong>left side</strong> of the development process so that it can happen earlier and more often during the design and development phase.</p>
<p>Shift-Left testing aligns with the DevOps principle of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) because <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/test-automation" target="_blank">automated tests</a> can be written alongside the code and executed as part of the development pipeline. This approach ensures that issues are caught early, developers receive immediate feedback, and overall software quality is improved.</p>
<p>To implement Shift-Left testing, organizations often rely on a variety of automated testing tools. While the choice of tools may vary based on team preference and specific projects, below are some popular tools for performing Shift-Left testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>Selenium</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
<li>SonarCube</li>
<li>JMeter</li>

<p>Let’s explore some of the reasons why Shift-Left is important in your DevOps processes:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/shift-left-testing-devops-benefits-celh5.png" alt="Benefits of Shift-Left"></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced cost</strong>: A goal of every organization is to reduce its <em>operating expenses</em> and maximize profit. When Shift-Left testing is factored into your development process, bugs are identified and fixed early, which is far less expensive than when you address them after deployment. This approach saves you both time and resources as reworks are minimal.</li>
<li><strong>Faster feedback and early detection</strong>: Shift-Left testing provides faster feedback on the quality of your code because you’re testing early in the development process. This means you and your team can catch bugs and detect issues before they escalate. Additionally, it reduces the likelihood of finding and fixing defects later in development or in production.</li>
<li><strong>Improved quality</strong>:  The overall experience of your application becomes more reliable and stable because you’ll likely find and fix bugs earlier before they impact your users’ experience.</li>
<li><strong>Faster time to market:</strong> Because defects are reduced and the development process is optimized, you can iterate faster and continuously release software.</li>
<li><strong>Improved collaboration and continuous learning:</strong> Shift-Left testing follows the DevOps principle of collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders. This means the team has a sense of responsibility and ownership, and they’ll learn more from one another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shift-Left testing advocates for testing earlier, moving the focus to the <strong>left side</strong> of the development process. You might wonder if this means testing ends after the design and development stages or if there’s something like <strong>right-side</strong> testing as you prepare to go live.</p>
<p>Well, you guessed right, there’s indeed Shift-Right testing. Let’s explore that next.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-shift-right-testing">What is Shift-Right testing?</h2>
<p>Shift-Right testing is a principle in DevOps that involves incorporating quality assurance and other testing activities <strong>later</strong> in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This is usually done when software has been released or is being used in production.</p>
<p>Unlike Shift-Left testing, which occurs at the beginning of the development process, Shift-Right testing occurs after the application has been deployed into production. It involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closely monitoring the application’s performance in the production environment to identify bugs and issues.</li>
<li>Gradually releasing new features to selected users to test their impact first before doing a full rollout.</li>
<li>Collecting feedback from users to understand the overall users’ experience and identify areas of continuous improvement.</li>
<li>Conducting A/B testing to compare different versions of the software or features to determine users’ behavior and outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/shift-right-testing-v86zs.png" alt="Shift-Right testing"></p>
<p>The main idea is to move system testing to the <strong>right side</strong> of the development process, ensure that the application performs well in real-world scenarios, and catch issues that may not be apparent during Shift-Left testing.</p>
<p>While Shift-Right testing comes with its own benefits when dealing with production-specific issues, it can be risky. The approach of fixing bugs in production can lead to downtime, cause a negative user experience, and damage your organization’s reputation.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-in-adopting-shift-left-testing">Challenges in adopting Shift-Left testing</h2>
<p>It’s important to understand that Shift-Left testing is not a “magic wand” that solves all your testing problems. It also comes with its own challenges. Below are some challenges you might encounter when adopting it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Required skills</strong>: Developers, testers, and other stakeholders may need to acquire new skills like test <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">automation</a>, continuous integration, and more. Training can be challenging for teams with limited resources.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural shift</strong>: Adopting continuous testing on the left side of the development process requires a cultural change for all the stakeholders. Developers may need to take on additional testing responsibilities, while testers may need to acquire new skills. This can lead to resistance, adding to their workload and responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Cost implication</strong>: The implementation process requires new toolsets and automation frameworks, which can be time-consuming and costly to set up. Additionally, teams must overcome the learning curve associated with these tools.</li>
<li><strong>Integration complexity</strong>: Integrating testing in the early stage of SDLC can be complex, particularly in legacy and large systems. This is because it requires that all team members are aligned and willing to adjust their roles and responsibilities to accommodate the new testing approach.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management</strong>: Testing early means teams must develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated with early testing and find a balance between early testing and potential risks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="overcoming-challenges-and-implementing-shift-left-testing">Overcoming challenges and implementing shift-left testing</h2>
<p>Adopting Shift-Left testing in your development process comes with several challenges, particularly related to resources and cultural resistance, which may overshadow the advantages it offers. To successfully implement Shift-Left testing, consider the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote a testing-first mindset</strong> and encourage cross-functional collaboration between your teams with an emphasis on shared ownership of the product.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in training and skill development</strong> focused on test automation, CI/CD, and other <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/best-practices" target="_blank">best practices in DevOps</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Choose <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">DevOps tools</a> that align with your organization’s needs</strong> and integrate seamlessly within your budget.</li>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> with a feature or pilot project, then gradually scale across the entire product chain. This approach will give your team the flexibility and the time to learn and refine strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Regularly conduct risk assessments</strong> to identify areas for improvement and implement corresponding mitigation strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices-for-implementing-shift-left-testing-principles">Best practices for implementing Shift-Left testing principles</h2>
<p>Below are some best practices to consider:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/shift-left-testing-devops-principles-0yrp4.png" alt="Shift-Left best practices"></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adopt early test plans</strong>: Create a plan that clearly outlines the testing goals and scope of the project. Also, ensure that testing is integrated into the early stages of your SDLC.</li>
<li><strong>Test automation</strong>: Use test <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation-tools" target="_blank">automation tools</a> to automate unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and other necessary test cases. Additionally, regularly update and maintain test scripts to keep them relevant and accurate when running CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration and communication</strong>: Use project management tools like Jira and Linear, along with traditional methods such as meetings, check-ins, and stand-ups, to facilitate communication and collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous learning</strong>: Encourage your team to keep up-to-date with the latest testing techniques and tools, participate in industry events to learn from experts, and share knowledge and best practices within the team.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="shift-left-testing-in-the-real-world">Shift-Left testing in the real world</h2>
<p>To gain a better understanding of how teams are using Shift-Left testing to build better applications, let’s explore two real-world examples: Microsoft and Uber.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h3>
<p>Over two and a half years, a Microsoft team successfully replaced 27,000 legacy tests with modern DevOps unit tests and a shift-left process. This approach allowed them to enhance software quality and performance goals.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/pr-rolling-ci-pipeline-jv1rp.png" alt="Microsoft, 2022. Pull request and rolling CI pipeline in action. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/shift-left-make-testing-fast-reliable#getting-faster"></p>
<p>Additionally, the Azure DevOps platform integrates various Shift-Left testing practices, which the team leverages to deliver reliable cloud services and tools to its customers. At the core of Shift-Left testing in Microsoft are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests at the lowest possible level.</li>
<li>Writing functional tests that can run anywhere.</li>
<li>Treating test code as product code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uber">Uber</h3>
<p>Uber’s adoption of the Shift-Left testing principle of putting the test at the forefront of its software development process has helped it minimize risk and ensure the reliability and safety of its ride-sharing platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/shift-left-testing-devops-uber-0xk2a.png" alt="Uber, 2024. Separation of testing data. https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/shifting-e2e-testing-left/"></p>
<p>One major change Uber made was to ensure they could test without deploying to production. This process requires launching a backend integration testing strategy <strong>(BITS)</strong> that enables on-demand continuous deployment and routing to test sandboxes. At the core of BITS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolating data between production and test environment.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://cadenceworkflow.io/?uclick_id=b36cfaa6-c7d0-4da0-a756-64e7e4c3466e" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cadence</a>, an open-source workflow engine, to define workflow state, retries, and timers for resource teardown.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>
<p>As businesses evolve, they will bring new challenges and use cases that need to be solved. This means as a DevOps engineer, you need to factor in tests early into the development process to maintain a balance between product quality and speed. Additionally, you need to stay up to date with the latest DevOps trends and toolchains that will help you build reliable applications.</p>

<p>The role of the DevOps engineer is not always very well defined; some companies see it as the old-school sysadmin whose sole purpose is to take care of the platform’s infrastructure. Others see it as the person in charge of the Terraform configuration files. In the end, properly understanding what DevOps is and what you should expect from this role is critical to properly taking advantage of it and adding the value it’s meant to be adding to your company.</p>
<p>While you can work on becoming a DevOps engineer from scratch (there is actually a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps roadmap</a> for that), usually, a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/devops-engineer" target="_blank">DevOps engineer</a> is someone who has spent enough years either as a developer or in an operations role and wants to start helping solve the problems they’ve experienced throughout their entire career. This person sits between both sides and has intimate knowledge of one of them and a great deal of knowledge about the other side.</p>
<p>With that said, understanding everything there is to know to become a DevOps engineer who excels at their job is not trivial, and that’s why in this article, we’re going to cover the top 10 DevOps skills to help you level up your <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/career-path" target="_blank">career in DevOps</a>.</p>
<p>The top 10 DevOps engineer skills to master are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding Linux and some scripting languages.</li>
<li>Knowing how to set up your CI/CD pipelines.</li>
<li>Embracing containerization and orchestration.</li>
<li>Learning about Infrastructure as Code.</li>
<li>Understanding cloud computing.</li>
<li>Knowing how to monitor your infrastructure and manage your logs.</li>
<li>Having a good grasp of security practices and tools.</li>
<li>Know how to set up your networking and what that entails for your infrastructure.</li>
<li>Knowing about version control.</li>
<li>And finally, understanding configuration management.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="1-proficiency-in-linux-and-scripting">1. Proficiency in Linux and Scripting</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/bash-code-in-terminal-zj6j1.png" alt="Bash code in terminal"></p>
<p>Linux is one of the most common operating systems in the world of software development because of its incredible support, performance, and flexibility, which makes mastering it one of the main DevOps skills to work on.</p>
<p>Granted, the word “master” is loaded and there are many aspects of the OS that you don’t really need to worry about these days (with all the containers and IaC tools around), however without pushing yourself too hard and becoming a full-blown developer, investing part of your time into learning one or more scripting languages is definitely a good call.</p>
<p>As a DevOps engineer, you will be scripting and automating tasks, so pick a couple of popular scripting languages and make sure you understand them enough to get the job done. For example, picking Bash is a safe bet, as Bash is the native scripting language in most Linux distros. On top of that, you can pick something like Python or Ruby; both are great options. With an English-like syntax that’s very easy to read and understand and a set of very powerful <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">DevOps automation</a> libraries and tools available, you should be more than fine. For example, if you’re picking Python, you’ll be able to work on Ansible playbooks or custom modules, and if you go with Ruby, you can write Chef cookbooks.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s either about your own preference or the company’s standards if there are any, just pick one and figure out the tools at your disposal.</p>
<h2 id="2-understanding-of-continuous-integration-and-continuous-deployment-cicd">2. Understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continous-development-vs-continuous-integration-l2fak.png" alt="continuous development vs continuous integration"></p>
<p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) form the backbone of a successful DevOps methodology. As a DevOps engineer, mastering CI/CD is non-negotiable.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-cicd">Understanding CI/CD</h3>
<p>At its core, Continuous Integration (CI) is about automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository as many times a day as needed (which can be one, zero, or hundreds; the number should be irrelevant).</p>
<p>The idea is to catch and fix integration bugs early and often, which is crucial for maintaining the health of your project.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) takes this a step further by automatically deploying the integrated code to production environments once it passes all necessary tests. Together, both practices minimize manual intervention, reducing errors and allowing for rapid and reliable delivery of software.</p>
<h3 id="key-tools-for-cicd">Key Tools for CI/CD</h3>
<p>To effectively implement CI/CD pipelines, you’ll need to be proficient with the tools that make it possible. There are tons of them out there; some of the most common (and arguably, best ones) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jenkins</strong>: An open-source automation server, Jenkins is highly customizable and supports a huge number of integration plugins.</li>
<li><strong>GitLab CI</strong>: Part of the larger GitLab platform, GitLab CI is tightly integrated with GitLab’s version control and issue-tracking features.</li>
<li><strong>CircleCI</strong>: Known for its speed and simplicity, CircleCI is perfect for environments that prioritize cloud-native solutions. It provides a user-friendly interface and integrates well with popular tools like Docker, AWS, and Kubernetes.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub, allowing developers to automate, test, and deploy their code right from their repositories. It supports custom workflows, integration with <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">other DevOps tools</a>, and provides flexibility to run complex automation tasks across multiple environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-setting-up-and-managing-cicd-pipelines">Best Practices for Setting Up and Managing CI/CD Pipelines</h3>
<p>Setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines isn’t just about getting the tools to work; it’s about ensuring that they work well (whatever “well” means for your specific context).</p>
<p>Here are some best practices to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small and Iterate</strong>: Don’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the most critical parts of your workflow, then gradually expand the pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Fast Feedback</strong>: The faster your CI/CD pipeline can provide feedback, the quicker your team can address issues.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a Stable Master Branch</strong>: Always keep your master branch in a deployable state. Implement branch protection rules and require code reviews and automated tests to pass before any changes are merged.</li>
<li><strong>Automate Everything Possible</strong>: From testing to deployment, automate as many steps in your pipeline as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and Optimize</strong>: Continuously monitor your CI/CD pipelines for performance bottlenecks, failures, and inefficiencies. Use this data to refine your process.</li>
<li><strong>Security Considerations</strong>: Integrate security checks into your CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early. Tools like static code analysis, dependency checking, and container scanning can help ensure that your code is secure before it reaches production.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-containerization-and-orchestration">3. Containerization and Orchestration</h2>
<p>These technologies are at the heart of modern DevOps practices, enabling scalability, portability, and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="basics-of-containerization">Basics of Containerization</h3>
<p>Containerization is a method of packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. Unlike traditional virtual machines, which require a full operating system, containers share the host OS’s kernel while running isolated user spaces.</p>
<p>This makes containers not only lightweight but also faster to start, and more resource-efficient.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to this technology, as you can probably glean by now, but the primary benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: Containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run, making it easy to move them across different environments. As long as there is a way to run containers in an OS, then your code can run on it.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. This flexibility is crucial when you need to handle dynamic workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: By using containers, you can ensure that your applications run the same way across different environments, reducing the infamous “it works on my machine” problem.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: With container applications, don’t use resources outside of the ones defined for them. This means each application is isolated from others running on the same host server, avoiding interference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-containerization-tools">Key Containerization Tools</h3>
<p>When it comes to containerization tools, Docker is the most popular and widely adopted alternative. However, other tools like Podman are also gaining traction, especially in environments that prioritize security and compatibility with Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Both tools offer robust features for managing containers, but the choice between them often comes down to specific use cases, security requirements, and integration with other tools in your DevOps toolkit.</p>
<h3 id="orchestration-tools">Orchestration Tools</h3>
<p>While containerization simplifies application deployment, managing containers at scale requires something else: orchestration.</p>
<p>Orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring that they run efficiently and reliably across distributed environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong>: Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes provides a comprehensive platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications by managing clusters of containers.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Swarm</strong>: Docker Swarm is Docker’s native clustering and orchestration tool. It’s simpler to set up and use compared to Kubernetes, making it a good choice for smaller teams or less complex projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-infrastructure-as-code-iac">4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become a foundational practice for DevOps teams. IaC allows you to manage and provision your infrastructure through code, offering a level of automation and consistency that manual processes simply can’t match.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-iac-in-modern-devops-practices">Importance of IaC in Modern DevOps Practices</h3>
<p>IaC is crucial in modern DevOps because it brings consistency, scalability, and speed to infrastructure.</p>
<p>IaC allows teams to define their infrastructure in code, which can be versioned, reviewed, and tested just like application code. If you think about it, IaC is the perfect example of what DevOps means: the merger of both worlds to achieve something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Nowadays, IaC is not just a “best practice” but rather, an indispensable part of a DevOps engineer’s workflow, and here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency Across Environments</strong>: As we’ve already mentioned, with IaC, you can ensure that your environments are all configured exactly the same way.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Whether you need to add more servers, databases, or other resources, you can do it quickly and reliably by updating your code and reapplying it.</li>
<li><strong>Version Control and Collaboration</strong>: By storing your infrastructure configurations in a version control system like Git, you enable better collaboration and control.</li>
<li><strong>Automation and Efficiency</strong>: Once your infrastructure is defined in code, you can automate the provisioning, updating, and teardown of resources, allowing your team to focus on higher-value tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-iac-tools-terraform-ansible-chef-puppet">Key IaC Tools: Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet</h3>
<p>Several tools have become go-to solutions for IaC, each offering unique strengths.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular ones; however, feel free to pick others if they fit better in your particular use case/context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terraform</strong>: Terraform is one of the most widely used IaC tools. It’s cloud-agnostic, meaning you can use it to manage infrastructure across different cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Ansible</strong>: While Ansible’s main focus is automating configuration tasks across multiple servers, it is capable of also working as an IaC tool by providing support for infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and orchestration.</li>
<li><strong>Chef</strong>: Chef is another strong player in the configuration management space. It uses a Ruby-based language to create “recipes” that automate the deployment and management of infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Puppet</strong>: Puppet offers a solid solution for configuration management, using its own declarative language to define the state of your infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-writing-and-managing-infrastructure-code">Best Practices for Writing and Managing Infrastructure Code</h3>
<p>Like with any coding project, writing clean and easy-to-read code will help a great deal in making the project itself a success. That’s no different in the case of IaC, the words “clean code” need to be engraved in every DevOp’s mind.</p>
<p>And this is what “clean” means in this context:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modularize Your Code</strong>: Break down your infrastructure code into smaller, reusable modules. This approach is especially useful for larger projects where the infrastructure files grow in number; this way you can reuse sections and simplify maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Use Version Control</strong>: Store all your infrastructure code in a version control system like Git. This practice enables you to track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back if something goes wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Test Your Infrastructure Code</strong>: Just like application code, infrastructure code should be tested. Tools like Terraform provide validation for configurations, and frameworks like Inspec or Testinfra can verify that your infrastructure is working as expected after deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the Principle of Least Privilege</strong>: When defining infrastructure, ensure that each component has only the permissions it needs to perform its function. This practice reduces security risks by limiting the potential impact of a breach or misconfiguration.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Secrets Secure</strong>: Avoid the rooky mistake of hardcoding sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, directly into your infrastructure code. Use tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to manage secrets securely.</li>
<li><strong>Document Your Code</strong>: Just like application code, your infrastructure code should also be commented on and explained, not for you now, but for you next week or someone else next month. The easier it is to understand the code, the faster they’ll be able to work with it.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate IaC into CI/CD Pipelines</strong>: Automate as much as possible in the IaC workflow. That includes the validation, testing, and deployment of your infrastructure code by integrating it into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures that your environments are always up-to-date and consistent with your codebase, reducing the risk of drift.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5-cloud-computing-expertise">5. Cloud Computing Expertise</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cloud-providers-wb1f5.png" alt="cloud providers"></p>
<p>In the DevOps ecosystem, cloud computing is more than just a trend companies are starting to follow—it’s a fundamental element that defines modern software development and deployment practices.</p>
<p>And because of that, it’s one of the main DevOps skills you’ll want to develop.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-cloud-platforms-in-devops">Importance of Cloud Platforms in DevOps</h3>
<p>Cloud platforms have revolutionized the way software is developed, deployed, and managed. The cloud allows organizations to leverage vast computing resources on demand, scale their operations effortlessly, and reduce infrastructure costs.</p>
<p>Specifically for DevOps teams, cloud platforms offer several key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: One of the most significant advantages of cloud computing is its ability to scale resources up or down based on demand. This elasticity is crucial for handling varying workloads, ensuring that applications remain responsive and, most importantly (as some would argue), cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>Speed and Agility</strong>: Provisioning of resources can be done with just a few clicks, allowing DevOps teams to spin up development, testing, and production environments in minutes. This speed accelerates the software development lifecycle, enabling faster releases and more frequent updates.</li>
<li><strong>Global Reach</strong>: Cloud providers operate data centers around the world, making it easier for organizations to deploy applications closer to their users, reducing latency and improving performance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: This is a recurring topic when discussing cloud platforms, as they help reduce the need for large upfront capital investments in hardware. Instead, organizations can pay for the resources they use, optimizing costs and reducing waste.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Cloud environments are highly automatable, allowing DevOps teams to automate infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and management.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-cloud-providers-aws-azure-google-cloud-platform-gcp">Key Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h3>
<p>When it comes to cloud providers, three providers dominate the market: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). While they’re not the only ones, and in some regions of the world, they’re not even the top providers. In general, they own most of the cloud market.</p>
<p>Each of them offers a vast array of services and tools that cater to different needs, making them the go-to choices for DevOps professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>: AWS is the largest and most mature of the three, offering an extensive range of services, including computing power (EC2), storage (S3), databases (RDS), and more. AWS is known for its large number of features, including advanced networking, security, and analytics tools. For DevOps engineers, AWS provides powerful services like AWS Lambda (serverless computing), AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD), and CloudFormation (IaC), which are essential for building and managing cloud-native applications.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>: Azure is a close competitor to AWS, particularly strong in enterprise environments where Microsoft technologies like Windows Server, SQL Server, and .NET are prevalent. Azure offers a very rich list of cloud services, including, like the other two, virtual machines, AI, and machine learning tools. Azure also offers DevOps-specific services like Azure DevOps, which integrates CI/CD, version control, and agile planning into a single platform. Azure’s hybrid cloud capabilities also make it a popular choice for organizations that need to integrate on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources.</li>
<li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong>: GCP, while newer to the cloud market compared to AWS and Azure, has quickly gained a reputation for its data analytics, machine learning, and container orchestration services. Google’s Kubernetes Engine (GKE), for instance, is quite liked by the DevOps community for managing containerized applications at scale. GCP is also known for its strong support of open-source technologies, making it a favorite among developers who prioritize flexibility and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-cloud-native-tools-services-and-architectural-patterns">Understanding Cloud-Native Tools, Services, and Architectural Patterns</h3>
<p>Another key technical skill for DevOps engineers is to understand not only cloud-native tools and services but also the architectural patterns that define modern application development.</p>
<p>These patterns define how applications are structured and interact with cloud infrastructure, directly affecting areas such as scalability, resilience, and maintainability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>: In a microservices architecture, applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate over APIs. Key tools to understand by DevOps engineers include <strong>API gateways</strong> (like AWS API Gateway), <strong>service meshes</strong> (such as Istio), and <strong>message queues</strong> (like Amazon SQS or Google Pub/Sub).</li>
<li><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong>: SOA is a broader (and older) architectural style where services are designed to provide specific business functionalities and can communicate with each other over a network. Tools like <strong>Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs)</strong> and <strong>message brokers</strong> (such as RabbitMQ) are often used to facilitate SOA architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless Architecture</strong>: Serverless computing allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. In a serverless architecture, code is executed in response to events, such as HTTP requests or changes in data, using services like <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong>Azure Functions</strong>, or <strong>Google Cloud Functions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>: In an event-driven architecture, applications respond to events in real-time, often using tools like <strong>event streams</strong> (e.g., Apache Kafka) and <strong>message queues</strong>.</li>

<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/monitoring-logging-servers-ztf1a.png" alt="monitoring logging servers"></p>
<p>Monitoring and logging are vital components of a robust DevOps strategy. They provide visibility into the health and performance of your systems, allowing you to detect issues early, troubleshoot, and ensure the reliability of your applications.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-monitoring-and-logging-for-maintaining-system-health">Importance of Monitoring and Logging for Maintaining System Health</h3>
<p>No matter what type of application you’re running, maintaining the health and performance of your systems is crucial if your business depends on it.</p>
<p>Monitoring and logging has turned into one of the most relevant DevOps skills out there.</p>
<p>Through monitoring you can track the performance of your infrastructure and applications in real-time, alerting you to any potential problems such as resource bottlenecks, slowdowns, or outages.</p>
<p>Logging, on the other hand, captures detailed records of system events and user interactions, providing invaluable information for diagnosing problems and understanding system behavior.</p>
<p>The reasons why you want to have effective monitoring and logging, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive Issue Detection</strong>: By continuously monitoring system metrics, you can detect issues before they escalate into critical problems, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis</strong>: Logs provide detailed information about system events, making it easier to pinpoint the root cause of issues. This speeds up the resolution process and minimizes the impact on users.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Monitoring allows you to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify areas where your systems can be optimized, leading to better resource utilization and cost savings.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance and Auditing</strong>: Logging is essential for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. Logs can be used to audit system access, track changes, and ensure that your systems meet security and operational standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-tools-for-monitoring-prometheus-grafana-nagios">Key Tools for Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios</h3>
<p>Several tools have become essential for monitoring systems in DevOps environments. Each offers unique features tailored to different needs, from real-time metrics collection to visual dashboards and alerting.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-setting-up-effective-monitoring-and-logging-systems">Best Practices for Setting Up Effective Monitoring and Logging Systems</h3>
<p>While both practices are crucial for a successful DevOps strategy, if you ignore best practices the results you’ll get will be subpar, at best.</p>
<p>Instead, try to follow these (or some of them) guidelines to ensure you get the most out of your monitoring and logging efforts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define Clear Objectives</strong>: Before setting up your monitoring and logging systems, define what you want to achieve. Identify the key metrics and logs that are most critical to your operations, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, application response times, and error rates.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Comprehensive Monitoring</strong>: Monitor all layers of your infrastructure, from hardware and networks to applications and services. Use a combination of tools to ensure that no aspect of your system goes unmonitored. If you ignore one area, you’ll end up having blindspots when debugging and trying to troubleshoot problems.</li>
<li><strong>Centralize Log Management</strong>: Centralizing your logs in a single platform like the ELK Stack or Splunk allows for easier management, search, and analysis. This centralization is particularly important in distributed systems where logs are generated across multiple servers and services.</li>
<li><strong>Set Up Alerts and Notifications</strong>: Monitoring without alerting is like watching a movie without any sound; if you constantly pay attention to the picture, you might figure out what’s happening on a general level, but you’ll miss the details. And with monitoring, it’s the same thing: set up alerts and notifications so when a threshold is exceeded (say, the number of error responses in the last 10 minutes), you’ll know, even if it’s in the middle of the night.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Scalability</strong>: As your infrastructure grows, your monitoring and logging systems need to scale accordingly. Choose tools that can handle increasing volumes of data without compromising performance. In other words, don’t turn your logging/monitoring setup into a bottleneck for your platform.</li>
<li><strong>Regularly Review and Tune</strong>: Continuously review and adjust your monitoring and logging configurations. As your systems evolve, your monitoring and logging needs may change, requiring you to add new metrics, refine alert thresholds, or optimize data retention policies.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Your Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure</strong>: Protect your monitoring and logging data from unauthorized access. Ensure that logs containing sensitive information are encrypted and access to monitoring dashboards is restricted based on roles.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="7-security-practices-and-tools-devsecops">7. Security Practices and Tools (DevSecOps)</h2>
<p>As DevOps has transformed software development by integrating development and operations teams together into a seamless process, security can no longer be treated as an afterthought. The rise of DevSecOps emphasizes the need for DevOps engineers to develop their security skills.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-security-into-the-devops-pipeline">Integrating Security into the DevOps Pipeline</h3>
<p>DevSecOps shifts the classical paradigm (having security reviews happen at the end of the development lifecycle) by integrating security into every phase of the DevOps pipeline—from code development to deployment and beyond. That, in turn, involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift-Left Security</strong>: This principle involves moving security practices earlier in the SDLC, such as during the coding and design phases.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Security</strong>: Security checks should be continuous and automated throughout the pipeline. This ensures that each code change, build, and deployment is evaluated for security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration and Culture</strong>: DevSecOps is as much about culture as it is about tools. Developers, operations, and security teams must collaborate closely, sharing responsibility for security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-security-practices">Key Security Practices</h3>
<p>To effectively integrate security into the DevOps pipeline, certain practices are essential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Security Testing</strong>: Automation is key to scaling security practices within a rapidly growing DevOps environment. Automated security testing involves integrating security checks into your CI/CD pipelines. This can include static application security testing (SAST) to analyze source code for security flaws, dynamic application security testing (DAST) to evaluate running applications, and interactive application security testing (IAST) that combines both approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Regular vulnerability scanning is crucial for identifying and mitigating risks across your infrastructure and applications. Scanning tools can detect known vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, container images, and cloud configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Security as Code</strong>: Just as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) treats infrastructure configuration as code, Security as Code applies the same principles to security configurations. This involves automating the provisioning and management of security controls, policies, and compliance checks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools-for-devsecops">Tools for DevSecOps</h3>
<p>Several tools have emerged to support the integration of security into the DevOps practice. These tools help automate security tasks, identify vulnerabilities, and enforce security policies, making it easier for teams to adopt DevSecOps practices.</p>
<p>Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aqua Security</strong>: Aqua Security specializes in securing cloud-native applications, particularly those that run in containers. Aqua provides a comprehensive platform for securing the entire container lifecycle, from development to runtime.</li>

<h4 id="git-workflows">Git Workflows</h4>
<p>Git can be used as the driving force for your development workflow. However, there are many ways to use it. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature Branch Workflow</strong>: Developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Once complete, the branch is merged back into the main branch, often through a pull request, where code reviews and automated tests are conducted.</li>
<li><strong>Gitflow Workflow</strong>: A more structured workflow that uses feature branches, a develop branch for integration, and a master branch for production-ready code. It also includes hotfix branches for urgent bug fixes in production.</li>
<li><strong>Forking Workflow</strong>: Common in open-source projects, this workflow involves forking a repository, making changes in the fork, and then submitting a pull request to the original repository for review and integration.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="best-practices-when-using-git">Best practices when using Git</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commit Often, Commit Early</strong>: Make small, frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages. This practice makes it easier to track changes and revert specific parts of the codebase if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Use Meaningful Branch Names</strong>: Name branches based on the work they are doing, such as <code>feature/user-authentication</code> or <code>bugfix/login-issue</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Perform Code Reviews</strong>: Use pull requests and code reviews as part of the merge process.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a Clean Commit History</strong>: Use tools like <code>git rebase</code> to clean up your commit history before merging branches. A clean commit history makes it easier to understand the evolution of the project and debug issues.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-managing-configurations-across-environments">Best Practices for Managing Configurations Across Environments</h3>
<p>Effective configuration management requires you to follow best practices that ensure consistency, reliability, and security across all environments.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Configuration as Code (CaC)</strong>: Treat configurations as code by storing them in version control systems like Git.</li>
<li><strong>Modularize Configurations</strong>: Break down configurations into reusable modules or roles. This approach allows you to apply the same configuration logic across different environments.</li>
<li><strong>Test Configurations in Multiple Environments</strong>: Before deploying configurations to production, test them thoroughly in staging or testing environments.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Idempotency</strong>: Ensure that your processes are idempotent, meaning that applying the same configuration multiple times does not change the system after the first application.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization</strong>: Use a centralized tool to maintain a single source of truth for all configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypt Sensitive Data</strong>: When managing configurations that include sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys), use encryption and secure storage solutions like HashiCorp Vault.</li>
<li><strong>Document Configurations and Changes</strong>: Maintain detailed documentation for your configurations and any changes made to them.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and Audit Configurations</strong>: Continuously monitor configurations to detect and prevent drift (when configurations deviate from the desired state).</li>
</ol>

<p>Long gone are the days when putting a new feature into production meant 3 months of planning, coordination, and careful delivery. The industry has evolved into a new, faster, and more agile way of working.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for months before pushing something into production, companies are now able to do it multiple times a day, any day (even Fridays!).</p>
<p>All of that is thanks to DevOps test automation, or in other words, thanks to the ability to include tests into the DevOps pipeline. That allows teams to confidently promote to production code that is tested and validated by a machine.</p>
<p>How does that all work? Let’s dive in and I’ll explain it all.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-devops-test-automation">What is DevOps Test Automation?</h2>
<p>DevOps test automation refers to the integration of automated testing into the DevOps pipeline to ensure that every piece of code is properly tested throughout the development lifecycle. It plays a vital role in achieving the speed and reliability that DevOps promises, helping teams deliver high-quality software faster.</p>
<p>Test automation removes the human factor from the process (at least from most of it) and eliminates the bottlenecks caused by manual testing by running tests more frequently, consistently, and at scale.</p>
<h3 id="manual-testing-vs-automated-testing">Manual Testing vs. Automated Testing</h3>
<p>Manual testing involves testers executing test cases step-by-step and verifying the results. It is valuable for tasks requiring human intuition, such as exploratory testing or evaluating user interfaces. However, these manual tests tend to be slow, labor-intensive, and inconsistent (we’re all human after all).</p>
<p>Automated testing, on the other hand, uses scripts and tools to run tests automatically. This type of testing actually includes multiple different types of tests with unit tests being one of the most common ones (although there are alternatives, such as integration tests, e2e tests, etc). This approach offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Automated tests execute much faster than manual ones, after all, as long as the system can handle the input, your test will work.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Automated tests provide consistent results, eliminating human error.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Large test suites can be run efficiently, even across complex scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Test scripts can be reused across multiple projects and cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this has the potential to directly translate into faster feedback loops, higher test coverage, and more reliable software releases.</p>
<h3 id="key-components-of-devops-test-automation">Key Components of DevOps Test Automation</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> Continuous Integration is a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. With each integration, an automated build and test process is triggered. The goals of CI include:
<ul>
<li>Catching issues early by testing incremental code changes.</li>
<li>Ensuring that new changes don’t break the existing codebase.</li>
<li>Reducing integration problems by addressing conflicts early and often.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> Continuous Delivery ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state. It extends CI by automating the deployment process to staging or production environments. The key principles of CD include:

<h3 id="why-devops-test-automation-matters">Why DevOps Test Automation Matters</h3>
<p>By combining CI, CD, and Continuous Testing into a cohesive DevOps strategy, organizations can accelerate delivery while maintaining high software quality. Test automation reduces the manual effort required for testing, provides faster feedback, and ensures that every code change is reliable and ready for production.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-in-devops-test-automation">Challenges in DevOps Test Automation</h2>
<p>While DevOps test automation brings significant benefits, implementing and maintaining it comes with its own set of challenges. These problems usually come from cultural, technical, and operational complexities.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at some common challenges and how they impact DevOps teams:</p>
<h3 id="cultural-and-organizational-barriers">Cultural and Organizational Barriers</h3>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to successful DevOps test automation is resistance to change within the organization. DevOps relies on collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams, but traditional silos can make this difficult.</p>
<p>For example, development and operations teams may have conflicting goals, such as speed versus stability. There might be a lack of shared ownership for testing that can lead to gaps in responsibility, effectively not having anyone owning the practice.</p>
<p>And finally, teams may resist adopting new tools or affecting the existing (and working) development lifecycle due to unfamiliarity or fear of disrupting established workflows.</p>
<h4 id="strategies-to-overcome">Strategies to Overcome</h4>
<p>Consider fostering a collaborative culture by promoting shared goals and open communication. Make sure to provide training and resources to help teams adapt to new tools and methodologies, this will lower the entry barrier and show how new tools and practices actually can improve existing processes.</p>
<p>In the end, encourage leadership to advocate for DevOps practices, emphasizing their long-term value to the organization.</p>
<h3 id="tool-integration-and-maintenance">Tool Integration and Maintenance</h3>
<p>DevOps pipelines often rely on a diverse set of tools for version control, CI/CD, test automation, and deployment. Integrating these tools into a cohesive workflow can be difficult, especially when dealing with legacy systems or custom applications.</p>
<p>If you’re not careful during the tool selection process, or if you just don’t have control over it, you might end up in a situation where these tools may not seamlessly integrate with each other, leading to broken pipelines or data silos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even if they do work well together, maintaining automated test scripts can be time-consuming, especially as applications evolve.</p>
<p>And finally, frequent updates to tools or frameworks can potentially introduce compatibility issues.</p>
<h4 id="strategies-to-overcome-1">Strategies to Overcome</h4>
<p>If you have the ability to pick or change existing solutions, make sure to use platforms like Jenkins, Azure DevOps, or GitLab that support a wide range of integrations.</p>
<p>Try to adopt modular test automation frameworks to simplify script maintenance. Remember to handle this code like you would the code of any large software project.</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, if you want to avoid the build-up of technical debt in your toolchain, try to regularly review and update toolchains to ensure compatibility.</p>
<h3 id="scalability-and-performance-issues">Scalability and Performance Issues</h3>
<p>As applications grow in complexity and user bases expand, test automation frameworks must scale to handle increased workloads. However, ensuring scalability while maintaining performance is not a trivial task.</p>
<p>These frameworks will struggle to handle large test suites or datasets, causing either tests to run slow, or even crash for reasons completely unrelated to the code they’re testing. If you’re not careful, performance bottlenecks can occur when running tests on shared resources potentially affecting the main system through your tests.</p>
<h4 id="strategies-to-overcome-2">Strategies to Overcome</h4>
<p>At this stage, you have to be smart about how you implement testing. Consider using parallel test execution to reduce overall test runtime.</p>
<p>Use cloud-based testing platforms like Sauce Labs or BrowserStack to scale testing infrastructure dynamically and much faster for a fraction of the price you’d have to pay if you were to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, optimize test suites by removing redundant or outdated tests and prioritizing high-impact cases. In other words, consider that some types of tests might be better off applied to only a portion of your app (key features) instead of testing the entire system.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-test-automation-tool">Choosing the Right Test Automation Tool</h3>
<p>Test automation tools form the backbone of successful automation testing strategies. The right tools can simplify workflows, improve test coverage, and ensure seamless integration with your CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-effective-devops-test-automation">Best Practices for Effective DevOps Test Automation</h2>
<p>Successfully implementing DevOps test automation requires addressing challenges with proactive strategies and best practices. These practices help teams build a strong foundation for collaboration, skill development, and process improvement. Let’s take a closer look at the key actions organizations can take:</p>
<h3 id="foster-a-collaborative-culture">Foster a collaborative culture</h3>
<p>DevOps thrives on the seamless collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams. In fact, it depends on it. A lack of alignment can slow down progress and reduce the effectiveness of test automation.</p>
<p>We can encourage that collaboration by promoting cross-functional teams (as opposed to vertical teams working in isolation from each other with their own individual priorities) where responsibilities are shared, and everyone is invested in testing and quality.</p>
<p>Fostering that sense of belonging to a greater group by holding regular meetings or retrospectives to discuss challenges, share insights, and align goals.</p>
<p>Finally, using collaborative tools like Jira, Slack, or Confluence to ensure transparent communication and knowledge sharing.</p>
<h3 id="invest-in-training-and-skill-development">Invest in Training and Skill Development</h3>
<p>Test automation tools and frameworks often require specialized knowledge, and a lack of expertise can hinder adoption. Ensuring team members have the necessary skills is critical for long-term success. The good news is that skills can be trained and developed over time. So let’s take a look at some ideas to grow them.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is to conduct workshops and training sessions on test automation tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Appium. That way you update your teams about the latest trends in the industry while at the same time, providing them with practical knowledge they can then, turn around, and apply to their own projects.</p>
<p>Certifications are also a fantastic way to skill up from the “official” sources. Who better to teach your team how to use a product than those who can certify you on it? So make sure to encourage team members to obtain certifications in DevOps practices and tools.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also provide access to online learning platforms such as Coursera, Pluralsight, or Udemy for self-paced learning.</p>
<p>Investing in skill development empowers teams to use automation tools effectively, leading to higher productivity and better results.</p>
<h3 id="select-appropriate-tools-and-frameworks">Select Appropriate Tools and Frameworks</h3>
<p>The success of test automation depends heavily on choosing the right tools and frameworks. Tools that align with your technology stack and organizational needs will simplify implementation and reduce maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>So make sure to assess the compatibility of tools with your existing technology stack (e.g., programming languages, CI/CD systems). Prioritize tools with strong community support and regular updates, such as Jenkins, Selenium, or TestNG.</p>
<p>Opt for tools that offer integrations with your DevOps pipeline to streamline workflows, the more out-of-the-box integrations you can get, the better.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-and-optimize-test-automation-processes">Monitor and Optimize Test Automation Processes</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, implementing test automation is not a one-time task. Continuous monitoring and improvement are necessary to ensure that your processes remain efficient and effective as your application and pipeline evolve. In other words, stay on top of your testing process, pick up on problems as soon as they show up on your radar and implement some of the following best practices.</p>
<p>First things first, make sure to use metrics like test coverage, execution time, and defect detection rates to evaluate effectiveness. Compare those values release after release to understand the evolution of your project’s organization.</p>
<p>If monitoring is what you’re looking for, then consider implementing dashboards for real-time visibility into test automation performance.</p>
<p>Regularly review test cases to eliminate redundant or outdated ones, focusing on high-priority scenarios.</p>
<p>And of course, try to gather feedback from developers and testers to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>DevOps test automation is a cornerstone of modern software development, enabling organizations to accelerate software delivery without compromising quality. By integrating automated testing into the development lifecycle, teams can identify and resolve issues early.</p>
<p>To fully realize its benefits, organizations must address challenges such as cultural barriers, tool integration, and scalability.

<p>Both <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> and Agile are designed to help organizations build robust software. But when should you choose one over the other? Which approach works best for your project? Can you combine them effectively to maximize their benefits?</p>
<p>Having worked as an engineer on projects of all sizes, I’ve experienced firsthand how Agile and DevOps shape workflows and outcomes. In this guide, I’ll discuss their core principles, key differences, and practical use cases to help you decide which approach fits your needs.</p>
<h2 id="devops-vs-agile-core-values-and-goals">DevOps vs. Agile: Core values and goals</h2>
<p><strong>Agile</strong> is a project management and software development approach that breaks down the project into several dynamic phases, <strong>known as sprints</strong>, rather than completing an entire project at once. This approach enables teams to adapt to changes quickly, continuously improve the delivery pipeline, and stay focused on meeting customer needs.</p>
<p>It was born from the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> in 2001 as a response to the challenges faced with traditional project management models like the Waterfall method, which often leads to delay, rigidness, and disconnects between customers’ demands and what developers have built.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/agile-timeline-174xo.png" alt="Agile timeline"></p>
<p>The core values of Agile methodologies are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual over processes and tools</strong>: To prioritize human communication and collaboration across cross-functional teams rather than working independently.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to change over following a plan</strong>: To embrace changing requirements at every stage of the development process. The flexibility allows the team to quickly change workflow and strategies without derailing the entire project.</li>
<li><strong>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</strong>: To incorporate continuous customer feedback and use it to shape the project deliverables and align the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation</strong>: To ensure that the software that Agile teams develop works effectively, while additional tasks like documentation should not take center stage in the development process.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you use Agile in your application development or other types of software development process, it offers numerous benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding quickly to market changes and customer feedback.</li>
<li>Improving collaboration by fostering open communication, frequent iterations, and shared ownership.</li>
<li>Increasing customer satisfaction throughout the development process.</li>
<li>Enhancing quality through frequent reviews and continuous testing.</li>
<li>Empowering teams to innovate and solve problems creatively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DevOps,</strong> on the other hand, is a set of tools, practices, and a cultural philosophy that bridges the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to enhance the delivery pipelines. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring to ensure rapid and reliable software deployment.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-timeline-f5wbv.png" alt="DevOps timeline"></p>
<p>DevOps evolved as an extension of Agile to solve the bottleneck around operations, particularly in deployment, releases, and post-production maintenance. Its core values focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collaboration and communication</strong>: Foster a culture where developers, IT operations teams, QA teams, and other stakeholders actively collaborate and communicate throughout the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Increase efficiency and minimize errors by automating repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</strong>: Implement automated pipelines to test, integrate, and deploy code quickly and reliably.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics and monitoring</strong>: Use real-time monitoring and analytics to identify issues, optimize performance, and asses system health.</li>
<li><strong>Customer-centric focused</strong>: Center development and operations processes around delivering value to customers with high-quality releases that meet their needs.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: Establish a culture of seeing the DevOps process as not a one-time thing but rather a continuous process that promotes a feedback loop and learns from success and failure.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>: Treat infrastructure provisioning and maintenance as code to enable version control, scalability, and reproducibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you adopt DevOps in your development process, it offers numerous benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating software releases with streamlined processes and automation.</li>
<li>Reducing operational costs through efficient workflows and fewer bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Improving software quality with automated testing to reduce bugs and enhance reliability.</li>
<li>Resolving issues faster using continuous monitoring and real-time system insights.</li>
<li>Enhancing security by integrating security practices into the development lifecycle (DevSecOps).</li>
<li>Gaining a competitive advantage through faster innovation and the ability to adapt quickly to market changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both DevOps and Agile offer numerous benefits that help you and your team build robust and scalable applications. But when should you choose one over the other? And what types of projects are best suited for each approach?</p>
<p>Let’s dive into their usage and application next.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>
<p>If your workflow is to develop software in small, manageable parts, Agile will be ideal for you. For example, if you’re developing a new application, you can release the core features first, get feedback, and add more functionality over time.</p>
<p>DevOps, on the other hand, is perfect for delivering software quickly and maintaining its stability. For example, if you’re managing a large-scale ticketing platform, DevOps ensures updates without downtime.</p>
<h2 id="team-structure">Team structure</h2>
<p>Agile works well with small teams of developers, designers, and testers where everyone can collaborate closely. For instance, if you’re building a product for a startup, Agile methodology guarantees everyone is aligned.</p>
<p>In contrast, DevOps facilitates collaboration between development and operations teams to manage the entire process, from writing code to running in production.</p>
<h2 id="project-size-and-change-frequency">Project size and change frequency</h2>
<p>Agile is well-suited for small to medium projects that want to launch their minimum viable product (MVP) or add new features to an existing platform that accounts for customers’ needs along the way.</p>
<p>DevOps, in contrast, is good for large or complex projects that involve infrastructure, automation, and scalability.</p>
<h2 id="project-delivery">Project delivery</h2>
<p>Agile uses sprint (a time-boxed iteration) for planned updates, which makes it ideal for projects that deliver new features frequently (e.g., every two weeks). Agile helps you stay organized and on schedule.</p>
<p>DevOps doesn’t use intervals like Agile, and it allows you to release updates as soon as they’re ready.</p>
<h2 id="customer-involvement">Customer involvement</h2>
<p>Agile works best when you need regular feedback from the customer at every stage of the development. In contrast, DevOps is better suited for scenarios where customers prioritize fast responses and high uptime.</p>
<h2 id="usage-of-tools-and-automation">Usage of tools and automation</h2>

<h2 id="how-do-a-devops-engineer-and-a-software-developer-differ">How do a DevOps engineer and a software developer differ?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/devops-engineer" target="_blank">DevOps engineer</a> focuses on automating infrastructure, managing deployments, and ensuring smooth integration between development and operations, while a software developer primarily writes code to build applications or features.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-engineer-vs-software-developer-qodix.png" alt="DevOps Engineer vs Software Developer"></p>
<p>A software developer creates quality code and builds software applications. They focus primarily on designing, development, application testing, and software maintenance.</p>
<p>Some may specialize in frontend, backend, or even full stack development, giving them the flexibility to manage comprehensive software projects.</p>
<p>For HR professionals, if your organization wants to improve operational efficiency and teamwork across departments, hiring a DevOps engineer could be a good choice. On the other hand, if your focus is on innovation and coding, a skilled software developer or full stack developer might be the better option.</p>
<p>A skilled software developer knows the right tools and programming languages essential to build applications. Some experts even have <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">frontend</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend</a>, or <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">full stack</a> development experience.</p>
<p>However, DevOps is a broader field that involves collaboration between the development and IT operations teams. Software developers majorly focus on writing codes, whereas DevOps ensures that the generated code works well.</p>
<p>Some of the key tasks of a software developer include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding and development:</strong> using different programming languages and frameworks to create clean code for your software.</li>
<li><strong>Testing:</strong> running tests to get more clarity on whether the implemented code functions correctly and guarantees smooth software performance.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: While traditionally managed by the DevOps team, many developers now handle deployment processes, especially in smaller teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, DevOps engineer’s key tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation DevOps</strong>: automating all the tasks from testing software to deploying CI/CD pipelines.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="importance-of-collaboration-with-cross-functional-teams-in-both-roles">Importance of collaboration with cross-functional teams in both roles</h2>
<p>Both developers and DevOps engineers need to collaborate with cross-functional teams for a smooth workflow.</p>
<p>Working with cross-functional teams is essential for both software developers and DevOps engineers. These interactions streamline workflows, improve communication, and ensure that each department’s needs and constraints are understood throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring resource tip:</strong> DevOps engineers may be more suitable for roles requiring collaboration across departments, whereas software developers, including full-stack developers, are better suited to focused development tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Career insight -</strong> As a software developer, your interaction might be limited to the design, development, and testing phases. However, moving toward DevOps expands your scope to include operational aspects, which could be beneficial for long-term career growth.</p>
<p>Software developers need to constantly communicate with other developers on the team, designers, and even quality assurance(QA) engineers to ensure the delivery of high-quality software. Their collaboration is primarily focused on software functionalities. In the early stages of the traditional software development process, developers were not very involved in how their code operated in production. A separate department, i.e., the IT operations team or deployment manager, was responsible for tracking application deployment.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/collaboration-and-team-dynamics-k302s.png" alt="Collaboration and team dynamics"></p>
<p>In the case of DevOps, things are completely different. Their collaboration with cross-functional teams goes beyond the development process. The DevOps concept was introduced to bridge the gap between development and operations for smooth workflow and rapid delivery. The development and IT operation team need to frequently communicate and provide quick feedback on different aspects for efficient software performance and deployment of code changes.</p>
<p>The incorporation of DevOps practices will enable organizations to improve their product quality, automate complex and repetitive tasks, detect errors in real time, and deploy new features in less time.</p>

<p>Over the years, the demand for high-quality software and resilient systems has grown significantly. Businesses are under immense pressure to deliver software faster than ever. However, rushing development often comes with trade-offs, such as increased security risks that can compromise entire systems.</p>
<p>Traditional development practices struggled to keep up with the need for both speed and security, creating a critical challenge for organizations. To address the challenge of balancing rapid software delivery with the need for robust security and quality, two models were introduced: DevOps and DevSecOps.</p>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/devops-engineer" target="_blank">DevOps</a> focuses on streamlining the development and operations lifecycle to deliver software quickly. DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps pipeline, prioritizing security from the start and throughout the entire development process.</p>
<p>In this blog, you will learn about the main purpose and role of DevOps and DevSecOps. You will also explore a comparison between the two, helping you determine which approach is right for your needs. Understanding the key differences and benefits is essential to choosing the right model, so keep reading!</p>
<p>Below is a quick comparison table of DevOps vs. DevSecOps for easier reference:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/comparison-table-of-devops-vs-devsecops-wcai5.png" alt="DevOps vs DevSecOps"></p>
<h2 id="devops-vs-devsecops-how-are-they-different">DevOps vs DevSecOps: How are they different?</h2>
<p>Choosing between DevOps and DevSecOps can determine whether your software is fast—or secure from the start.</p>
<p>While both approaches aim to enhance collaboration and efficiency in software development, DevSecOps incorporates security practices early in the development cycle, unlike DevOps, which often addresses security issues at a later stage.</p>
<p>DevOps is primarily focused on improving collaboration between design, development, and operations teams to speed up software delivery. The core idea is to remove bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the development pipeline. DevOps engineers are skilled in coding, automation, and system administration, and they focus on delivering high-quality software with minimal errors, often through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/understanding-devops-vs-devsecops-v9tkn.png" alt="Understanding DevOps vs DevSecOps"></p>
<p>On the other hand, DevSecOps brings security into the equation by integrating cybersecurity practices throughout the development process. This approach arose to address increasing cyber threats by embedding security checks at every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While DevOps ensures quick software delivery, DevSecOps emphasizes secure and compliant software delivery by shifting security considerations to the left of the development timeline, ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected early.</p>
<h2 id="security-in-devops-vs-devsecops-a-closer-look-at-processes-and-tools">Security in DevOps vs. DevSecOps: A Closer Look at Processes and Tools</h2>
<p>One of the key differences between DevOps and DevSecOps lies in how they handle security.
In DevOps workflows, security testing typically occurs near the end of the development cycle, during quality assurance or post-deployment. Security measures, such as patches or vulnerability scanning, are often applied as part of the release process. This can result in delayed launches or costly remediation efforts if critical issues are discovered late in the pipeline.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/role-of-security-rj7j1.png" alt="Role of security in DevOps and DevSecOps"></p>
<p>DevSecOps, on the other hand, focuses on strengthening deployment security and maintaining data protection and compliance by tracking issues as they arise. This approach uses both shift-left and shift-right security testing strategies. Shift-left testing involves identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process, even before code is merged.</p>
<p>Tools like static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and dependency checkers are embedded into CI/CD pipelines to catch publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Additionally, automated scanners and code analyzers ensure that potential risks are flagged before reaching production.</p>
<p>For example, in a DevOps environment, a team may identify security vulnerabilities only after a routine code audit or during the final phase of testing. However, in a DevSecOps setup, automated security checks would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, flagging issues in real time before code is deployed, saving time and mitigating risks.</p>
<h3 id="shift-left-and-shift-right-strategies">Shift-Left and Shift-Right Strategies</h3>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/shift-left-testing" target="_blank">Shift-left security</a> is a key component of DevSecOps. With early security testing (shift-left security), DevSecOps helps identify risks and prevent product compromise. Addressing errors during the production phase is far more cost-effective than fixing them after deployment. Additionally, continuous security testing reinforces compliance with industry standards.</p>
<p>A real-world example of the consequences of delayed security integration is the <a href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/data-breach/equifax/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2017 Equifax data breach</a>. A known vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework was left unpatched, resulting in the exposure of sensitive customer data for over 147 million people. Had shift-left security practices been in place, experts could have flagged the outdated library during the early stages of development and prevented breach.</p>
<p>Shift-right testing is equally important as it helps developers detect security threats and fix issues in real time. Delays in security threat detection can impact product integrity and customer trust.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine your organization is working on financial application design and creation, in which security processes and tests are supposed to run during the final phase.</p>
<p>In such a case, issue detection at the final phase can result in a product launch delay. This might also result in higher costs. And if, to avoid a launch delay, you introduce the product, the unresolved vulnerabilities can hamper your reputation and erode customer trust.</p>
<p>DevSecOps understands the impact of security issues and thus recommend implementing shift-left and shift-right strategies that help reduce vulnerabilities and achieve faster time to market, thus saving your organizational reputation and customer trust.</p>
<h2 id="how-devops-and-devsecops-affect-business-goals">How DevOps and DevSecOps affect business goals?</h2>
<p>DevOps and DevSecOps affects several key business such as time to market, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency and risk management. Here’s how they affect these goals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time to market</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>DevOps speeds up product delivery by automating workflows, removing bottlenecks and enabling faster iterations. DevSecOps puts the necessary checks in place without derailing development timelines so businesses can maintain a regular release cadence and meet market demand.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>DevOps delivers frequent updates and new features to keep up with customer demand and improve user experience. DevSecOps builds on this by delivering secure and reliable products, reducing the risk of issues that will frustrate users. Both speed and reliability increases customer trust and loyalty.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Operational efficiency</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>DevOps makes tasks more efficient by removing duplication, eliminating manual intervention. DevSecOps adds to this by addressing risks early, avoiding rework or operational downtime. Together they reduce development costs and increase productivity.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Risk management</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>DevOps allows for faster iterations and deployments which can introduce risks if not managed properly. DevSecOps mitigates these risks by making security a core part of the development lifecycle. This proactive approach reduces the chance of breaches or compliance issues and protects the business’s reputation and financials.</p>
<h2 id="core-processes-in-devops-and-devsecops">Core processes in DevOps and DevSecOps</h2>
<p>To accelerate the software development lifecycle, DevOps gives more attention to automation and collaboration. Monitoring in DevOps primarily focuses on performance, availability, and system uptime. Metrics like CPU utilization, application response times, and log aggregation form the foundation of DevOps monitoring strategies. Incident response, while essential, is reactive in nature—triggered only after an issue, such as a system crash or performance degradation, arises.</p>
<p>DevSecOps runs security tests in all stages, thus adopting a more proactive approach. Continuous monitoring in DevSecOps goes beyond traditional metrics to include threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks, focusing more on reducing risk and cost. They even use tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems and cloud-native security platforms to detect threats in real time. Incident response in DevSecOps involves automated playbooks and AI-driven analysis to address vulnerabilities, often before they can escalate rapidly.</p>
<p>In fact, DevSecOps even employs SAST and DAST strategies that help identify security vulnerabilities faster. Under SAST, professionals scans source code early to prevent vulnerabilities from entering production. Some of the common SAST tools are <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SonarQube</a> and <a href="https://checkmarx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Checkmarx</a>.</p>
<p>However, under the DAST strategy, professionals evaluate applications in their running state to identify vulnerabilities. Some of the common DAST tools are <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OWASP ZAP</a> and <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a> which help identify injection flaws and security misconfigurations.</p>
<p>Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), another practice that combines SAST and DAST, operates within the application runtime environment to provide detailed insights into vulnerabilities during testing and QA phases.</p>
<p>These advanced testing methodologies—SAST, DAST, and IAST—not only enhance security within specific stages of development but also lay the groundwork for broader, innovative practices in continuous security monitoring. These emerging practices are redefining traditional monitoring and response strategies:</p>
<h3 id="real-time-incident-response">Real-time incident response</h3>
<p>DevSecOps uses tools that use AI and machine learning for real-time threat detection and mitigation.</p>
<p>Examples of tools used for real-time response in DevSecOps are Splunk, Datadog Security Monitoring, and CrowdStrike Falcon which do AI driven threat detection and automated response to incidents.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral-analytics">Behavioral analytics</h3>
<p>Monitoring user and application behavior allows DevSecOps teams to detect anomalies such as data access or traffic patterns that are not normal which could be a breach.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-compliance">Continuous compliance</h3>
<p>DevSecOps embeds security policies and regulatory standards into the development process for continuous compliance. Teams use automation tools like Policy-as-Code frameworks and compliance scanners to enforce and validate against standards like GDPR, HIPAA and PCI DSS. This way reduces compliance risks and makes auditing easier.</p>
<h2 id="moving-from-devops-to-devsecops">Moving from DevOps to DevSecOps</h2>
<p>The shift from DevOps to DevSecOps is a critical evolution for organizations aiming to integrate security seamlessly into the development lifecycle. Below is a guide to facilitate this transition, highlighting actionable steps, tools, and strategies for success.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/moving-from-devops-to-devsecops-gimtv.png" alt="Moving from DevOps to DevSecOps"></p>
<h3 id="understand-your-goals">Understand your goals</h3>
<p>Before implementing changes or transitioning to DevSecOps, step back and clearly lay out your goals. What do you want to achieve after transitioning to the DevSecOps model? Are you looking to enhance your security model or need faster software deployment? Being specific with your goals will help you make informed decisions and develop a plan that aligns with your goals.</p>
<h3 id="current-flow-assessment">Current flow assessment</h3>
<p>Before transitioning to a new model, it is important to assess and change the existing workflow. Trace areas that demand or require improvement and attention. For example, check for proper coordination and communication among development, operations, and security teams. Are there any loopholes or faults in your current workflow? Is security feedback consistently integrated into development cycles? Identify gaps in communication by hosting cross-team retrospectives or root cause analyses to get more clarity of your situation.</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-right-automation-tool">Choose the right automation tool</h3>
<p>If workflow efficiency is an issue, the best solution is to implement automation tools. These common tools can reduce manual tasks, run faster code reviews, perform security tests, and provide quick deployment. These tools further enable professionals to focus on other key areas and tasks, such as fixing errors or initiating new features within the application.</p>
<h3 id="training-your-teammates">Training your teammates</h3>
<p>Adopting a new model or practice demands educating the team members early about the new process and security concerns. Inform and educate your team members about the importance of security systems and how integrating them can improve their overall performance. You can also run training sessions or seminars to cover more about security guidelines and standards. Help them understand rising security concerns, how to fill gaps, and how to integrate security throughout the software development cycle. This step will further prevent confusion and problems from escalating in the future.</p>
<p>Educating the team early prevents missteps and promotes ownership of the new processes. But. despite preparation, organizations often face challenges when transitioning to DevSecOps. Let us have a look at some common DevSecOps transition challenges.</p>
<h2 id="devsecops-transition-challenges">DevSecOps transition challenges</h2>
<p>Remember, transitioning to DevSecOps is not as easy as it sounds. There are various challenges, but these can be managed with the right approach.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devsecops-best-practices-m6e21.png" alt="DevSecOps Best Practices"></p>
<p>Here are a few things to avoid in the transition period:</p>
<h3 id="wrong-tool-selection">Wrong tool selection</h3>
<p>There is a wide range of security applications on the market, but make sure to select the right one that is relevant to your code and meets your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it hard to run in the long term.</p>
<p>For guidance on selecting the right tools, refer to the <strong>“Top tools and processes for a smooth transition”</strong> section, where we highlight specific tools and best practices to facilitate a successful DevSecOps implementation.</p>
<h3 id="non-inclusion-of-operations-and-security-teams">Non-inclusion of operations and security teams</h3>
<p>Security tests are conducted at every phase of software production. Excluding your operations and security teams from the monitoring and tracking process limits the ability to identify and address faults and bugs effectively. Involving security experts from the start allows them to provide guidance on misconfigurations, tools, and best practices.</p>
<h3 id="speed-over-quality">Speed over quality</h3>
<p>DevOps emphasizes quick software delivery, which can sometimes lead to insufficient attention to quality and security functionality. This may affect the user experience and your business reputation. Allocating more time and effort to ensuring quality and integrating security practices can help strike the right balance.</p>
<h3 id="code-monitoring-issues">Code monitoring issues</h3>
<p>Since code constantly changes in software production, keeping an eye on it at all times can be challenging for some professionals. It is important to introduce new configurations, tools, and practices that can identify vulnerabilities in real time.</p>
<h2 id="top-tools-and-processes-for-a-smooth-transition">Top tools and processes for a smooth transition</h2>
<p>Further, let’s have a look at how tools and processes can facilitate this transition while keeping agility and innovation intact:</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-security-first-cicd-configurations">Prioritize security-first CI/CD configurations</h3>
<p>CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern DevOps workflows. Embedding security into these pipelines guarantees vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated at every stage. So, incorporate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools.</p>
<p>Further, you can use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage sensitive information securely. Also, you can set policies to prevent critical vulnerabilities using tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-infrastructure-as-code-iac">Embrace infrastructure as code (IaC)</h3>
<p>IaC automates infrastructure provisioning, but it can also introduce risks if not properly secured. For a smooth transition, it is important to integrate security into IaC processes. You can invest in Terrascan to detect vulnerabilities in Terraform or implement <a href="https://devops.com/immutable-infrastructure-the-next-step-for-devops/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">immutable infrastructure practices</a> to reduce configuration drift. Further, you can conduct regular audits of IaC templates for misconfigurations.</p>
<h3 id="leverage-advanced-threat-modeling">Leverage advanced threat modeling</h3>
<p>Threat modeling makes certain that potential security risks are identified early. New tools and frameworks make this process more effective. Invest in AI-powered tools that automatically suggest mitigations for identified risks.</p>
<h2 id="will-devsecops-replace-devops">Will DevSecOps replace DevOps?</h2>
<p>No, DevSecOps will not replace DevOps; instead, it enhances it. Rather than being a replacement, DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps, bringing security practices into the development and operations workflow. While DevOps focuses on speed, collaboration, and efficiency, DevSecOps makes sure that security becomes an inherent part of these processes. For example, integrating security tools like Snyk or SonarQube into CI/CD pipelines helps organizations identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The two are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. DevSecOps acts as a bridge, ensuring that security doesn’t become a bottleneck while maintaining the agility of DevOps. This natural evolution addresses the growing need for secure software development without compromising agility. Let’s further learn how DevSecOps will evolve in the future.</p>
<h2 id="future-of-devsecops">Future of DevSecOps</h2>
<p>As cybersecurity threats grow in sophistication and compliance regulations tighten, DevSecOps is poised to become the cornerstone of secure software development. In the recent <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CrowdStrike Global Threat Report</a>, experts clearly stated that attacks hardly take a few minutes to succeed. The report also noted that CrowdStrike tracked over 230 adversaries leveraging the global adoption of cloud technologies for their attacks.</p>
<p>Tackling these challenges demands strategic teamwork and technical expertise. Here’s how DevSecOps is expected to evolve and why it is the future of secure DevOps:</p>
<h3 id="proactive-threat-mitigation">Proactive threat mitigation</h3>
<p>DevSecOps is transitioning from reactive to proactive security. Predictive threat analysis, enabled by AI and machine learning, will play a crucial role in identifying security concerns and vulnerabilities before exploitation. For example, tools like CrowdStrike will become essential for analyzing attack patterns.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-governance-and-compliance">Integration with governance and compliance</h3>
<p>Stricter regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA are driving a compliance-first culture. DevSecOps will increasingly integrate automated compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines, facilitating adherence to global standards without manual intervention.</p>
<h3 id="rise-of-zero-trust-architectures">Rise of zero-trust architectures</h3>
<p>The adoption of zero-trust principles will reshape security frameworks. DevSecOps will integrate zero-trust policies into development environments, guaranteeing continuous authentication and access verification. This approach will strengthen security for microservices and API-driven architectures.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-native-and-container-security">Cloud-native and container security</h3>
<p>With the surge in cloud-native applications, securing containers and serverless environments will be a top priority. Several tools are available that will enable seamless security integration into cloud workloads, addressing misconfigurations and runtime vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of demand and salary, DevSecOps roles tend to offer higher salaries due to the specialized skill set and smaller talent pool. Soon, there will be more role demands for security teams, DevSecOps engineers, security automation specialists, and compliance analysts job profiles to integrate security systems throughout the SDLC.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the differences between DevOps and DevSecOps, the choice comes down to your organization’s specific goals and priorities.</p>
<p>If speed and efficiency are your primary focus, DevOps is a great fit. However, if security is paramount, DevSecOps is the better choice. By embedding security into every stage of the development lifecycle, DevSecOps helps mitigate vulnerabilities while ensuring compliance and quality.</p>

<p>Full stack developers specialize in web development, while DevOps engineers <strong>focus</strong> on the smooth integration and delivery of software components.</p>
<p>Both roles offer great career opportunities. DevOps engineers can work in different sectors and organizations occupying different capacities.</p>
<p>Some DevOps specializations include code release manager, automation architect, DevSecOps engineer, etc. The same applies to a full stack engineer. As a full stack developer, you can work as a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner" target="_blank">frontend</a> or <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner" target="_blank">backend</a> developer.</p>
<p>DevOps developers and full stack developers are also in high demand. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367003/in-demand-it-roles/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Statista</a>, full stack developers and DevOps developers are among the top technical positions demanded by recruiters worldwide in 2023. Indeed reported that the average salary of a  <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/development-operations-engineer/salaries?from=top_sb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DevOps engineer</a> in the USA is $124,392, and that of a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/full-stack-developer/salaries?from=top_sb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">full</a> <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/full-stack-developer/salaries?from=top_sb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/full-stack-developer/salaries?from=top_sb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">stack software developer</a> is $124,120.</p>
<p>Before deciding which path to follow, some introspection is encouraged, and some factors are to be considered. Some of the things to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest</li>
<li>Strengths</li>
<li>Willingness to continously learn new skills and technology</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interest">Interest</h3>
<p>Considering your interests before choosing which path to follow is helpful. Building a career takes time and hard work, and it is advisable to do that in something you are interested in.</p>
<p>DevOps is probably the right choice if you are interested in automating repetitive tasks, servers and cloud management, containerization, monitoring, logging etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are interested in writing application and domain code and enjoy seeing what you build and how users interact with applications directly and indirectly, then it is advisable to choose full stack development.</p>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths</h3>
<p>In addition to your interests, it is also helpful to consider what your strengths are. This would help you to decide what you can work on effortlessly and with less struggle.</p>
<p>Do you find scripting easy? Are you able to grasp the complexities behind containerization and container orchestration? Do you spend more time writing infrastructure code than writing application and domain code? If your answer to these questions is yes, you should consider DevOps.</p>
<p>Can you easily convert mock-ups to actual user interfaces? Do you find it fascinating to translate customer requirements into code? Are you able to interact with databases using SQL without much hassle? If yes, then it might be worth going for full stack development.</p>
<h3 id="willingness-to-continuously-learn-new-skills-and-technology">Willingness to continuously learn new skills and technology</h3>
<p>The DevOps and full stack fields continually evolve, and there is always something new. To be up to date, you have to be willing and open to learning constantly. This involves taking courses, reading articles, and getting updates on things happening in the tech field.</p>
<p>Here is each role in detail to help you make a deeper consideration.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-a-devops-engineer">Who is a DevOps engineer?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> engineer who can also be referred to as a DevOps developer  is an IT professional with knowledge of development and operations. The development part involves writing codes and scripts, while the operations part includes managing on-premises and/or cloud infrastructure and system infrastructure.</p>
<p>In traditional software development, there is the challenge of having different teams working in silos. This siloed team structure makes it challenging to collaborate amongst teams, and the priorities and timelines of each team don’t align with other teams.</p>
<p>DevOps helps to bridge the gap between development teams and operations teams. DevOps experts often work in a collaborative surrounding where they can collaborate with software engineers and IT teams.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-lifecycle-simple-9lvkw.png" alt="DevOps process"></p>
<p>DevOps has some core principles that influence the effectiveness of development and operations. Some of these DevOps principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">Automation</a> of the software development lifecycle</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="automation-of-the-software-development-lifecycle">Automation of the software development lifecycle</h3>
<p>This involves automating tests, builds, and releases of software versions, as well as tasks that can slow down the software delivery process.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>It breaks the silos across teams and enables collaboration and communication. This creates horizontal slices and enhances productivity across teams.</p>
<p>A DevOps developer can use several programming languages for development. Some of them are <a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a>, Ruby, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/golang" target="_blank">Go</a>, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/rust" target="_blank">Rust</a>. Also, bash scripts help to automate processes.</p>
<p>Some organizations manage their own server infrastructure on-premise and deploy their applications on these servers. DevOps engineers are responsible for ensuring the servers run reliably and applications deploy successfully.</p>
<p>Cloud computing has gained popularity, and many software applications are deployed on various cloud computing platforms. There are cloud solution providers like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform</a> who take care of the server infrastructure and are mostly more reliable than the on-premise solution. One significant benefit of the cloud solution is that it is on a pay-as-you-go basis, i.e., you pay for only the cloud resources you use.</p>
<h2 id="skills-required-to-be-a-devops-engineer">Skills required to be a DevOps engineer</h2>
<p>DevOps engineers require soft and technical skills to succeed in their career path. The skills required include:</p>

<h2 id="who-is-a-full-stack-developer">Who is a full stack developer?</h2>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">Full stack developers</a> are software developers with extensive frontend and backend development knowledge. Their role is to handle the complete web development process, from designing the user interface to building the server-side logic.</p>
<p>The frontend of an application includes everything the user can see and interact with, i.e., the user interface. The backend consists of the things the user doesn’t see. These include the server-side and systems supporting the business logic.</p>
<p>Full stack coders also use <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">DevOps tools</a>. Depending on the project, a full stack developer may use DevOps technologies like GitHub and mongoDB to create software applications.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at frontend and backend development in greater detail.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-development">Frontend development</h3>
<p>It is concerned primarily with the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The common languages used in frontend development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the markup of the web page. CSS builds upon HTML and represents the style and format of the webpage. JavaScript is a programming language often used for frontend development and adds logic to your web page. You’ll find an excellent guide and roadmap to learning <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> on roadmap.sh.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/frontend-development-common-languages-25kzq.png" alt="Frontend development"></p>
<p>There are quite a few frontend frameworks out there. Some of the common ones are <a href="https://roadmap.sh/react" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/vue" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a>. For a more detailed guide, look at the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner" target="_blank">frontend beginners roadmap</a> or the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend" target="_blank">advanced frontend roadmap</a>.</p>
<h3 id="backend-development">Backend development</h3>

<p>When it comes to managing and enhancing software development and operations, companies often adopt sets of practices and processes such as Development Operations (DevOps) or Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). These approaches increase their ability to deliver applications scalably and maintain a fast pace.</p>
<p>In fact, companies and individuals seeking to deliver applications and services at a higher velocity are increasingly moving away from traditional software development and infrastructure management. They achieve this by either combining selected <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> and SRE practices or opting for one over the other.</p>
<p>Despite their shared goal of improving the software delivery process, some nuances set DevOps and SRE apart.</p>
<p>This guide provides an in-depth discussion of the key differences between each approach, what they entail, similarities, and the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">tools</a> and technologies involved. Finally, it offers roadmaps for your DevOps or SRE journey.</p>
<h2 id="differences-between-devops-and-sre">Differences between DevOps and SRE</h2>
<p>The primary difference between DevOps and SRE lies in their primary <strong>goals</strong>. DevOps aims to improve the software development lifecycle (SDLC), while SRE <strong>focuses</strong> on maintaining stability and resilience after application deployment. In addition, they also differ in <strong>scope</strong>, <strong>metrics</strong>, and <strong>team structure</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at these points in detail:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/the-difference-between-devops-and-sre-85kpt.JPG" alt="DevOps vs SRE"></p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>DevOps engineers’ primary focus is to improve the (SDLC) through process automation, enhance collaboration, and promote continuous improvement. Site Reliability Engineers aims to create easily maintained systems by automating processes,  manual and repetitive tasks, implementing monitoring and alerting systems, and designing for scale and resilience.</p>
<h3 id="roles-and-ownership">Roles and ownership</h3>
<p>In DevOps culture, developers, and other related stakeholders are often involved in operational tasks, sharing ownership of the entire software delivery process from development through to production.</p>
<p>In contrast, the SRE model promotes a clear separation between development and operations. The development team is focused on building and maintaining features, while the SRE team is responsible for the reliability and availability of services.</p>
<h3 id="scope-and-mindset">Scope and mindset</h3>
<p>DevOps is typically applied to self-contained applications or services, encouraging experimentation and innovation with opportunities to learn from failures. In contrast, SRE is applied to entire systems and platforms, primarily focusing on minimizing human error and downtime for the operations teams.</p>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<p>In measuring success, DevOps teams track metrics such as the time from code commit to deployment, deployment frequency, failure rate, and overall system performance. On the other hand, Site Reliability Engineers focus on metrics related to service level objectives like Mean Time to Recover (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), latency, traffic, and the frequency of errors occurring in the system.</p>
<h3 id="team-structure-and-processes">Team structure and processes</h3>
<p>DevOps teams work more like an Agile development team, ensuring collaboration between development and operations teams. They often break projects into smaller features and use <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/ci-cd" target="_blank">continuous integration(CI) / continuous delivery (CD)</a> to prioritize delivery based on business needs.</p>
<p>In contrast, SRE teams are highly specialized teams as compared to DevOps. They see the production environment as a highly available service and implement measures to address threats and failures that may arise from deployed features and integrations.</p>
<p>Both DevOps and SRE aim to enhance the software development process and operations. DevOps primarily focuses on software development and delivery, while SRE concentrates on software operations and maintenance after deployment, emphasizing reliability and scalability strongly.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-of-devops">Key components of DevOps</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1234098/software-development-process-changes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Statista</a>, DevOps adoption is expected to grow, with <strong>21% of respondents having integrated it into their source code management</strong>. Recruiters are also actively hiring for DevOps job roles, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1296668/top-in-demand-tech-skills-worldwide/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>with demand currently at 35.5%</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>One core principle of DevOps is automating manual processes within the SDLC, focusing on reducing costs and minimizing errors. In addition, DevOps embraces continuous integration, enabling companies to adapt and accommodate changes to end-users’ needs or business requirements.</p>
<p>The following are key aspects of DevOps:</p>
<h3 id="ci-and-cd">CI and CD</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of DevOps is to facilitate faster release cycles for software. This is achieved by continuously integrating code into a repository and automatically deploying it to the required environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cicd-xrwy2.JPG" alt="ci/cd"></p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Development processes such as testing, deployment, and infrastructural provisioning can be tedious, error-prone, and manual. DevOps addresses these challenges through automation.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/automation-mdtdr.jpeg" alt="automation"></p>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<p>Proactive monitoring of application performance, health, availability, and customer experience are some of the key principles of DevOps. With this capability, companies can identify issues quickly, iterate on solutions, and continuously improve.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/monitoring-uyfmx.jpeg" alt="metric"></p>
<h3 id="collaboration-and-communication">Collaboration and communication</h3>
<p>The overall goal of shipping secure and reliable software involves stakeholders like the development teams, operations teams, and other relevant teams to adhere to DevOps practices of collaborating and actively communicating throughout the SDLC.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/collaboration-t3wa1.jpeg" alt="collaboration &#x26; communication"></p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code</h3>
<p>Using scripts or declarative definitions to provision and configure infrastructure is a key component in DevOps. This approach enables teams to be consistent, efficiently manage resources, and reproduce environment-specific bugs.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-gj75w.jpeg" alt="iac"></p>
<h3 id="continuous-learning-and-improvement">Continuous learning and improvement</h3>
<p>In DevOps, teams are encouraged to share knowledge across teams, conduct service failure postmortem, and experiment with new ideas and potential solutions.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-of-sre">Key components of SRE</h2>
<p>Site Reliability Engineering can function as a tool, a set of best practices, or a strategy to automate IT operations tasks such as production system management, change management, and incident response. It empowers system administrators to manage large systems using code rather than manual methods.</p>
<p>The following are the key aspects of SRE:</p>
<h3 id="automation-1">Automation</h3>
<p>One key principle followed by Site Reliability Engineering is establishing a workflow to reduce manual and repetitive work related to operational tasks. SRE ensures that every team member has access to updated automation tools and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-alerting">Monitoring and alerting</h3>
<p>A core principle of SRE is using real-time monitored metrics and alerts to detect and respond to issues promptly before they impact the development teams and end users. With these systems in place, SRE teams can diagnose and resolve potential issues before they impact the system.</p>
<h3 id="forecast-and-planning">Forecast and planning</h3>
<p>Due to user traffic and workload, systems can experience increased demand and heavy resource usage. Site Reliability Engineering implements measures to ensure that such demand is properly handled by forecasting resources and managing related infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="incident-management">Incident management</h3>
<p>SRE teams define clear processes for detecting, diagnosing, and resolving incidents. When incidents occur, postmortems are conducted to identify root causes and prevent similar issues from recurring.</p>
<h3 id="service-level-objectives-slos">Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</h3>
<p>Site Reliability Engineering aims to deliver higher availability percentages, uptime, and other metrics such as error rates and response time to system customers or users.</p>
<p>These processes help software developers build and deliver software more efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="similarities-between-devops-and-sre">Similarities between DevOps and SRE</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/similarities-devops-sre-eqa7p.jpeg" alt="Similarities"></p>
<p>DevOps and SRE principles have become popular and widely adopted by organizations because they create robust and bug-free systems with continuous improvement in mind. Below are some key similarities between DevOps and SRE:</p>

As a developer, you should have at-least the basic understanding of how it works. This article is a brief introduction to what is DNS and how it works.</p>
<p>DNS at its simplest is like a phonebook on your mobile phone. Whenever you have to call one of your contacts, you can either dial their number from your memory or use their name which will then be used by your mobile phone to search their number in your phone book to call them. Every time you make a new friend, or your existing friend gets a mobile phone, you have to memorize their phone number or save it in your phonebook to be able to call them later on. DNS or Domain Name System, in a similar fashion, is a mechanism that allows you to browse websites on the internet. Just like your mobile phone does not know how to call without knowing the phone number, your browser does not know how to open a website just by the domain name; it needs to know the IP Address for the website to open. You can either type the IP Address to open, or provide the domain name and press enter which will then be used by your browser to find the IP address by going through several hoops. The picture below is the illustration of how your browser finds a website on the internet.</p>

<p>Front end development is probably one of the most dynamic fields in our industry, it’s constantly forcing developers to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. Either by learning about new frameworks or libraries, or simply by making them choose between their current stack and the hot new framework released every other month.</p>
<p>While working as a front end developer can be headache-inducing sometimes, it’s also a great field for those who love to constantly learn new technologies. Given how active and dynamic the frontend community is.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll try to help guide you through the constantly growing front end ecosystem and we’re going to cover 12 essential front end development skills that every front end dev should master to remain competitive and effective in their role.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-front-end-development">Understanding Front End Development</h2>
<p>But before we move forward, let’s first understand <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">what front end development is</a>.</p>
<p>Front end development involves creating the parts of a website or application that users interact with directly. This includes designing layouts, implementing visual elements, and ensuring a seamless user experience by coding the interactions through the use of three basic <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend/technologies" target="_blank">frontend technologies</a>: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Unlike backend development, which deals with server-side logic, front end development focuses exclusively on client-side logic.</p>
<p>With that said, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aren’t the only three front end developer skills you should be focusing on, in fact, there are many others that are just as important, so let’s take a quick look at them.</p>
<h2 id="1-htmlcssjavascript">1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/html-css-javascript-layers-7agjb.png" alt="html css and javascript layers"></p>
<p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundational <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend/languages" target="_blank">programming languages for front end development</a>. Mind you, they’re not the only skills that matter, but they’re definitely the three skills you should focus on first.</p>
<h3 id="html-hypertext-markup-language">HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: HTML is the backbone of any web page, providing the basic structure and content. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>: Semantic HTML5 elements (like <code>&#x3C;header></code>, <code>&#x3C;footer></code>, <code>&#x3C;article></code>, and <code>&#x3C;section></code>) improve accessibility and SEO. Proper use of these elements makes the content more understandable for both users, search engines and even accessibility devices (like screen readers).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="css-cascading-style-sheets">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: CSS is responsible for the visual presentation of the web page. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall style. While HTML lays out the foundational work for the page, CSS is a big component in making it look “good” for the users.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>: CSS3 introduces features like Flexbox, Grid Layout, animations, and transitions, which enable complex designs with less code. While trying to build responsive designs (which everyone should be doing by now), media queries, flexbox and grid are your friends, making web pages look good on all devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables features like form validation, content updates without page reloads, and interactive elements like sliders and carousels. In other words, while CSS makes it look “good”, JavaScript makes it interactive and reactive to the user’s actions.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>: Modern JavaScript (ES6+) introduces features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, modules, and promises. These features make the code more concise and readable. Whether you’re an old developer looking to become a front end developer, or a new one just getting started, adopting these features is key to your success as a JavaScript developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mastering these three key front end developer skills is not just about knowing the syntax but also understanding how to use these technologies together to create responsive, interactive, and accessible web pages.</p>
<h2 id="2-accessibility">2. Accessibility</h2>
<p>Accessibility ensures that websites are usable by people with various disabilities (from being sight-challenged to having other types of mobility-related disabilities).</p>
<p>In the end, the web should be accessible to everyone, and knowing and understanding about accessibility allows you to make your web-based products something that everyone can use.</p>
<p>This practice includes practices that range from implementing proper HTML tags, ARIA roles, all the way up to proper keyboard navigations. Accessible websites are not only compliant with legal standards but also offer a better user experience for a broader audience. Tools like screen readers and voice recognition software rely on well-structured, accessible content to function correctly.</p>
<p>You can read more about Accessibility in the web space by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chEEnz0MJ10" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">listening to this interview I did</a> with an accessibility expert.</p>
<h2 id="3-version-control">3. Version Control</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/gitflow-example-j1iu3.png" alt="git flow"></p>
<p>Version control is an essential skill for any front end developer, as it allows you to manage and track changes to your codebase efficiently. It provides a structured way to collaborate with other developers, maintain a history of changes, and ensure the integrity of your code. Here’s a more detailed look at why this skill is crucial and how to use it effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: When working on a project with a team, version control systems (VCS) enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts. Each developer can create their own branches, make changes, and then merge their work into the main codebase.</li>
<li><strong>History and Documentation</strong>: These systems maintain a history of all changes made to the code. This is invaluable for tracking when and why changes were made, which helps in debugging and understanding the evolution of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong>: Version control acts as a backup system. If something goes wrong with the current code, developers can revert to previous versions without losing their work. This is a massive benefit for teams and honestly, for solo developers as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="popular-version-control-systems">Popular Version Control Systems</h3>
<p>While the de-facto standard is Git, it’s also interesting to learn that Git is not the only VCS option out there (even though it’s the recommended option):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Git</strong>: The most widely used version control system. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning every developer has a complete copy of the repository. This allows for offline work and provides redundancy.</li>
<li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong>: A centralized VCS where the repository is stored on a server, and developers check out the latest version to work on. This option is slowly fading out, and is mostly in use only by teams that inherit it as a company-wide standard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<p>Regardless of the solution you use for this, try to keep in mind these best practices that will make your life (and your teammate’s life) a lot easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent Commits</strong>: Make small, frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages. This makes it easier to track changes and debug issues.</li>
<li><strong>Branching Strategy</strong>: Use a branching strategy that fits your workflow. Common strategies include <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Git Flow</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub Flow</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: Use pull requests to facilitate code reviews. This helps maintain code quality and fosters collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-responsive-web-design">4. Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/responsive-design-example-6j7wq.png" alt="responsive design example"></p>
<p>Responsive web design ensures that a website looks and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.  With the increasing use of mobile devices, responsive design is key for providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
<p>From the implementation side, one of the key elements to achieve responsive web design, are media queries. Through the use of media queries, developers can test for multiple screens and viewport sizes and style different sections of the page accordingly.</p>
<p>That said, if media queries sound too complex or just not flexible enough (given that testing for every screen size can be too much nowadays), the alternative is to create a “flexible grid”, in other words, a layout that by definition, can adapt to the current screen size automatically.</p>
<p>The main responsive design techniques to use for these flexible grids are: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">multi-column layouts, flexbox</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">grid</a>. Either way, whatever you decide to go with, they will all provide you with a flexible layout right off the bat.</p>
<h2 id="5-basics-of-ux">5. Basics of UX</h2>
<p>As a front end developer, you are not strictly in charge of designing and defining the user experience standards, however, in some team compositions (especially when they work for smaller companies), the front end developers are also in charge of defining aspects of the user experience.</p>
<p>Understanding the basics of user experience (UX) design helps developers create websites that are not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use. This includes, in theory,  knowledge of design principles, user research, and usability testing. However,  front end developers, given their partial contact and responsibility over the UX, don’t usually go deep into UX, but rather, take a more practical approach, learning from experts or from their own past experience.</p>
<p>A solid grasp of UX principles allows developers to build interfaces that meet users’ needs and expectations, leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Satisfaction</strong>: Good UX design leads to higher user satisfaction by making interfaces intuitive and enjoyable to use. Users are more likely to return to and recommend a product that provides a positive experience.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Engagement and Retention</strong>: A well-designed UX keeps users engaged and encourages them to spend more time on a site or app. This can lead to higher retention rates and better overall performance metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong>: In a crowded market, products with superior UX stand out. Investing in UX design can provide a competitive edge by attracting and retaining more users compared to products with poor UX.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Business Goals</strong>: Good UX design aligns with business objectives by enhancing user satisfaction, which can lead to increased conversions, sales, and customer loyalty. It ensures that the product meets both user needs and business goals effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-basics-of-seo">6. Basics of SEO</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/serp-results-rny9a.jpg" alt="SERP results"></p>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential for ensuring that a website is discoverable by search engines. This involves optimizing the site’s content, structure, and performance to rank higher in search engine results.</p>
<p>Key aspects of SEO include using relevant keywords, creating high-quality content, optimizing meta tags, and ensuring fast load times. Effective SEO practices can significantly increase organic traffic to a website.</p>
<p>With that said, why should this be of interest to a front end developer? Shouldn’t there be an SEO expert taking care of all of this?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is “yes, there should be”, however, as a front end developer, you do benefit from having some basic understanding of how SEO works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased visibility and traffic</strong>: Good SEO practices improve a website’s ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). As a front end developer you have control over how the page is rendered, including how fast it does it and the information that is provided to search engines In other words, you have full control over the traffic and visibility of the project you’re working on.</li>
<li><strong>Career advancement</strong>: As businesses increasingly recognize the importance of online presence, the demand for developers with SEO expertise is growing. Front End developers who can implement SEO best practices are more valuable to employers and clients, leading to better - job opportunities and career growth.</li>
<li><strong>Improved code quality</strong>: SEO-friendly code is usually cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain (there are no guarantees though). By adhering to SEO best practices, front end developers tend to produce code that is well-structured and follows industry standards, leading to fewer bugs and more scalable projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-restful-apis">7. RESTful APIs</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/restfulapi-from-frontend-dev-8msjn.png" alt="RESTful API"></p>
<p>RESTful APIs are a key piece of technology for front end developers to master. Mind you, not from the POV of creating them, but rather, understanding how to use and interact with them.</p>
<p>These APIs are used to connect the front end of a web application to its backend services. Understanding how to work with APIs, including making HTTP requests and handling responses, is essential for integrating dynamic data into your web applications (i.e. data from your database, data from a third party API, etc).</p>
<p>Familiarity with REST principles and tools like <a href="https://postman.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman</a> can help developers efficiently test and debug API integrations. As a front end developer, by understanding how RESTful APIs work, you gain the following “superpowers”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Content</strong>: RESTful APIs allow front end applications to request and receive data from servers dynamically. This enables the development of interactive and responsive applications that can update content without requiring a full page reload.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: By using RESTful APIs, front end developers can separate the user interface from the backend logic (dumping the responsibility of creating the backend logic on backend developers). This division allows each part of the application to be developed, tested, and maintained independently, leading to cleaner and more manageable codebases.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility</strong>: RESTful APIs provide a standardized way to interact with backend services. This standardization makes it easier to scale applications and integrate with various third-party services. Front End developers can easily connect to different data sources and services as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Collaboration</strong>: Working with RESTful APIs improves collaboration between front end and backend teams. Clear API documentation and standardized endpoints enable teams to work in parallel without dependencies, speeding up the development process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-testing-and-debugging">8. Testing and Debugging</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/breakpoint-debugging-izun3.jpg" alt="breakpoint debugging"></p>
<p>Testing and debugging are crucial for ensuring that your code is functional and free of errors. While this applies to both front end and backend development alike, we tend to oversimplify the complexity of the front end logic (in our minds) and, usually, we try to avoid writing tests for it.</p>
<p>However, there is a reason why so many testing frameworks exist for the front end: because front end logic is just as complex and requires just as much care and attention as backend logic.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that familiarity with testing frameworks like Jest and debugging tools in modern browser DevTools will help you maintain high-quality code standards. However, keep in mind these are not magical tools, and they will not automatically make your code better, you still have to put in the effort.</p>
<p>Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing are all important practices to ensure that different parts of the application work correctly both individually and together.</p>
<p>As front end developers, you’ll want to focus on debugging and testing to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Code Quality</strong>: Regular testing helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, resulting in cleaner and more reliable code. This, as you’ve probably guessed by now, reduces the likelihood of errors in production, ensuring a smoother user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Developer Efficiency</strong>: By using debugging tools and techniques, developers can quickly pinpoint and resolve issues, ideally,  saving time and effort.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Maintenance</strong>: Well-tested code is easier to maintain and extend, period. Test suites act as a safety net around your code, and as new features are added, existing functionality remains stable (and safe), reducing the risk of introducing new bugs. This makes it easier to scale applications over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-browser-devtools">9. Browser DevTools</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/chrome-dev-tools-ef41z.jpg" alt="chrome devtools"></p>
<p>Browser DevTools are essential for inspecting, debugging, and profiling your web applications. Directly built-in to browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari, these tools provide a suite of features for diagnosing and fixing issues in your code. Developers can use these tools to inspect HTML elements, modify CSS styles in real-time, monitor network requests, and analyze performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p>If you’re still wondering why a front end developer should focus on browser DevTools, these are the main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate Feedback</strong>: Browser DevTools allow developers to inspect and modify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real
time. This immediate feedback is crucial for quickly diagnosing and fixing issues without the need to reload the page.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Debugging Capabilities</strong>: DevTools provide powerful debugging features, such as setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables. These capabilities make it easier to identify and resolve bugs in complex applications.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Performance tabs in DevTools enable developers to analyze the loading and runtime performance of their applications. Tools like the Lighthouse audit and the Network panel help identify bottlenecks and optimize resource loading, leading to faster and more efficient web applications.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design Testing</strong>: DevTools offer features for testing responsive designs across different screen sizes and devices. The device toolbar allows developers to simulate various mobile and tablet environments, ensuring that applications provide a consistent experience across all platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Network Analysis</strong>: The Network panel provides insights into all network requests made by the application, including fetches, XHRs, and resource loading. This information is crucial for debugging network issues, understanding load times, and optimizing the overall performance of the application.</li>
<li><strong>CSS and Style Debugging</strong>: The Elements panel allows developers to inspect and manipulate the DOM and CSS. It provides tools to edit styles, view CSS rules, and understand the computed styles for any element, making it easier to fine-tune the visual aspects of an application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10-at-least-one-framework-react-vue-angular">10. At Least One Framework (React, Vue, Angular)</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/react-angular-vue-logos-se584.png" alt="react, angular &#x26; vue logos"></p>
<p>While in theory, all you need to be a front end developer is JavaScript + HTML + CSS, in practice, there are tools available (i.e. frameworks and libraries) that will help you speed up your dev process and produce much cleaner and maintainable code than what you would normally produce on your own.</p>
<p>And in fact, those tools will also let you focus on the actual application you’re building, leaving the extra, presentation-related logic to the framework.</p>
<p>We are, of course, talking about modern <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend/frameworks" target="_blank">front end frameworks</a> (or libraries) such as React, Vue, or Angular.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other options out there, such as Svelte, Solid, or even just the native Web Components that all major browsers support nowadays. However, while those are very valid options, the main 3 still remain the most used options and if you’re <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend/how-to-become-frontend-developer" target="_blank">looking to become a front end developer</a>, you’ll want to first focus on one of them.</p>
<p>Each framework has its own strengths and use cases, so understanding their core concepts and ecosystems can significantly enhance a developer’s productivity.</p>
<p>Now the question remains: which one is the right one for you? That’s entirely up to you to decide, but here are some of the highlights of each framework:</p>
<h3 id="highlights-about-react">Highlights about React</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Component-Based Architecture</strong>: React’s component-based structure promotes reusability and maintainability. Components encapsulate logic, styles, and behavior, making the code more modular and easier to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual DOM</strong>: React’s use of a virtual DOM improves performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM. This approach results in faster updates and a smoother user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Large Ecosystem and Community</strong>: React has a huge ecosystem of libraries, tools, and a strong community. This support makes it easier to find solutions, share knowledge, and access a wide range of third-party integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, React is not a full-fledged framework but a library, providing flexibility in choosing additional tools and libraries for routing, state management, and other functionalities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="highlights-about-angular">Highlights about Angular</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-Featured Framework</strong>: Angular provides a complete solution with built-in tools for routing, state management, form handling, and HTTP requests. This reduces the need for third-party libraries and offers a cohesive development experience.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Way Data Binding</strong>: Angular’s two-way data binding simplifies the synchronization between the model and the view, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for updates.</li>

<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Vue allows for extensive customization and can be integrated with other projects or libraries. It offers both a simple core library and advanced features for larger applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11-web-performance">11. Web Performance</h2>
<p>Web performance is a key aspect of front end development because it affects many areas around the product. And not only on the technical side, but also from the business side as well, considering how performance affects the way users experience and interact with your app.</p>
<p>In simple terms, optimizing web performance involves making your website load faster and run more efficiently. In the space of front end development, performance optimization techniques include minimizing HTTP requests, optimizing images (as in reducing their size without losing quality), using lazy loading (async loading of portions of your app or specific components), and leveraging browser caching.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-you-care-about-web-performance-as-a-front-end-developer">Why should you care about web performance as a front end developer?</h3>
<p>As a front end developer, the performance of your user interface is your responsibility, however, here are other reasons in case that’s not enough:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: As already mentioned, fast-loading websites provide a better user experience. Users are more likely to stay on a site and interact with it if pages load quickly and smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>SEO Benefits</strong>: Another way to focus on SEO as a front end developer, is to focus on the performance of your app. Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor. Faster websites are more likely to rank higher in search results, driving more organic traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion Rates</strong>: <a href="https://www.speedsense.com/insights/web-performance-impact-ecommerce-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Studies show</a> that even a small delay in page load time can significantly reduce conversion rates. Improving performance can directly impact the bottom line by increasing sales and sign-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Performance</strong>: With the increasing use of mobile devices, optimizing performance for mobile users is essential. Mobile networks can be slower in some parts of the world, making performance optimizations even more critical.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="12-typescript">12. TypeScript</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/image3-y7ryl.png" alt="typescript logo"></p>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing (amongst other things). It helps catch errors early during development and helps to make your code more maintainable.</p>
<p>As a front end developer, learning TypeScript can enhance your JavaScript skills and improve the quality of your code by giving you both types and higher-level OOP constructs (such as interfaces) to add more structure to your written logic.</p>
<p>By providing these extra tools, TypeScript enables developers to write more predictable and robust code.</p>
<p>Is your code going to be automatically better because of this? No, it’s not. You will still have to pay attention to what you’re writing and building, and you will still have to apply many of the concepts mentioned throughout this article.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-typescript">Getting started with TypeScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Official Documentation</strong>: The TypeScript Handbook is an excellent resource for learning the basics and advanced features of TypeScript.</li>
<li><strong>Check out the TypeScript Roadmap</strong>: If you’re wondering what steps to take on your way to learning TypeScript, take a look at the TypeScript Roadmap to learn exactly what you need.</li>
<li><strong>Community Resources</strong>: The TypeScript community is active and supportive. Joining forums, participating in discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow, and following TypeScript-related blogs can provide valuable insights and help.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="react">React</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/react-logo-d5ice.png" alt="React"></p>
<p>React was created by Facebook in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular frontend frameworks (though technically a library). Initially developed to solve the challenges of building dynamic and complex user interfaces for Facebook’s apps, React introduced the revolutionary concept of the virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which allowed developers to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that changed instead of re-rendering the entire page.</p>
<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
<p>React uses a virtual DOM (the Virtual Document Object Model) to optimize performance by minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM. This allows React to efficiently update only the components that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire page. While React is fast, performance can be impacted in large applications if not managed carefully, especially with unnecessary re-renders or poorly optimized state management (two concepts that have created a lot of literature around them, and yet, most developers still get wrong).</p>

<h2 id="understanding-full-stack-development">Understanding full-stack development</h2>
<p>Full stack development involves both frontend and backend work. It means you’re not just limited to designing the parts of a website or application that users interact with (frontend), but also managing the server, database, and application logic that power those interactions (backend).</p>
<p>Plus, full-stack developers need to be proficient in working with both relational and non-relational databases, setting up and maintaining infrastructure, and ensuring that their applications are scalable and secure. In other words, if they need to, full-stack developers can be the equivalent of a one-man army. Is this an ideal situation? No, it isn’t. In fact, a better way to look at a full stack developer is to think of them as a wildcard that can be placed in any team, and they’ll consistently add value to it, with minimum ramp-up time needed.</p>
<p>With that foundation in mind, let’s dive into the specific skills you need to master.</p>
<h2 id="1-basic-understanding-of-http">1. Basic understanding of HTTP</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/understanding-http-pct23.png" alt="basic understand of HTTP"></p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: understanding HTTP. HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of any interaction on the web. It’s what allows clients (like your web browser) and servers to communicate with each other. As a full-stack developer, having a solid grasp of HTTP is crucial for building, debugging, and maintaining web applications. It’s your bread and butter, and you’ll need to internalize it if you hope to become great at your job.</p>
<h3 id="why-http-matters-for-full-stack-developers">Why HTTP Matters for Full Stack Developers?</h3>
<p>Without HTTP, the internet as we know it wouldn’t function, it’s that simple. For a full-stack developer, understanding HTTP means you can effectively manage how your frontend communicates with your backend.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts-to-understand-in-http">Key Concepts to understand in HTTP</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP Methods</strong>: These are the actions that can be performed on a resource. The most common methods are GET (to retrieve data), POST (to send data to the server), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove data). Each method has a specific purpose and knowing when to use each one is essential for building efficient APIs. You can read the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">full list of verbs here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Status Codes</strong>: HTTP status codes are responses from the server to the client’s request. They indicate whether the request was successful, if there was an error, or if further action is needed. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 403 (Forbidden). Understanding these codes helps in debugging and improving user experience. Here’s the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">full list of status codes</a> in case you’re wondering.</li>
<li><strong>Headers</strong>: HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between the client and server. They carry essential information like content type, authorization information (in some cases even credentials), and cache control. Familiarity with headers allows you to manage security, content negotiation, and request-response flow more effectively. While you can create your own, here’s a list of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">standard set of HTTP headers</a>.</li>

<h2 id="6-consuming-and-creating-restful-apis">6. Consuming and Creating RESTful APIs</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/restful-apis-q1gvl.png" alt="restful apis"></p>
<p>For full stack developers, working with RESTful APIs is a fundamental skill that bridges the front-end and back-end of web applications. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate with each other, enabling your front-end to interact seamlessly with server-side logic and data.</p>
<h3 id="consuming-restful-apis">Consuming RESTful APIs</h3>
<p>Consuming APIs involves making HTTP requests from your front-end application to retrieve or send data to the server. Here are the key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP Methods</strong>: Understanding the different HTTP methods is crucial. We’ve already mentioned them above when describing HTTP itself, so make sure to check out the links listed there for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints and Routes</strong>: An API endpoint is a specific path where your API can be accessed by a client. Each endpoint corresponds to a route in your back-end server, handling specific requests. In the case of RESTful APIs, these routes refer to resources in your system.</li>
<li><strong>Request and Response</strong>: When consuming an API, the front-end sends a request to the server and receives a response. The request typically includes headers (metadata about the request) and a body (data sent to the server), while the response contains the status code, headers, and data.</li>
<li><strong>Fetching Data</strong>: In JavaScript, you can use the native fetch API or libraries like Axios to make HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-restful-apis">Creating RESTful APIs</h3>
<p>Creating APIs involves setting up server-side routes and handling requests. Here’s how to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Routes</strong>: In your back-end framework (like Express for Node.js or Django for Python), define routes that correspond to different endpoints. Each route should handle a specific HTTP method.</li>
<li><strong>Handle Requests and Responses</strong>: For each route, write logic to handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses. Use status codes to indicate the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).</li>
<li><strong>Middleware</strong>: Middleware functions in frameworks like Express can process requests before they reach the endpoint handlers. They’re useful for tasks like authentication, logging, and data validation.</li>
<li><strong>Database Integration</strong>: Often, your API will interact with a database. Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Sequelize for SQL databases or Mongoose for MongoDB to manage database operations.</li>
<li><strong>REST Principles</strong>: Ensure your API follows REST principles, such as statelessness (each request is independent), resource-based URLs (use nouns for endpoints), and appropriate use of HTTP methods. You can <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">read here</a> the full details about REST from the paper that defined the concept.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-databases">7. Databases</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/relational-cb-vs-non-relational-db-9r4m5.png" alt="relational databases"></p>
<p>Understanding both relational and non-relational databases is crucial for managing and storing data effectively in your applications. Each type of database has its own strengths and use cases, and knowing when to use each is essential for building robust and scalable applications.</p>
<h3 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h3>
<p>Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. Here are some key relational databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>: MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational databases. It’s known for its ease of use (a common choice for new developers) and performance.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its advanced features and compliance with SQL standards. It supports complex queries, transactions, and extensibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</li>
<li><strong>SQLite</strong>: SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that’s easy to set up and use. It’s often used in embedded systems and applications that require a simple, self-contained database engine. You’re not going to see big systems using SQLite for its main database, but it’s very common in small projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-relational-databases">Non-Relational Databases</h3>
<p>Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store data in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are some popular non-relational databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It’s highly flexible and scalable, making it ideal for applications that require quick iterations and schema flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Redis</strong>: Redis is an in-memory key-value store known for its high performance and speed. It’s commonly used for caching, real-time analytics, and as a message broker.</li>
<li><strong>Cassandra</strong>: Cassandra is a distributed, wide-column store designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers without any single point of failure. It’s highly scalable and suitable for applications that require high availability and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, like with many other technologies, there is not one single option that’s better than the others. It’s more about your particular needs and the features of each database. When having to decide on a specific database option, try to understand their capabilities and try to match them to your particular context.</p>
<h2 id="8-hosting-and-infrastructure">8. Hosting and Infrastructure</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/deployment-infrastructures-jrvr9.png" alt="deployment infrastructure"></p>
<p>For full stack developers, understanding hosting and infrastructure is essential for deploying and managing their web applications. This involves knowing where to host your applications, how to set up servers, and how to ensure your application runs smoothly and efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of key concepts and services in this area:</p>
<h3 id="cloud-hosting-providers">Cloud Hosting Providers</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting providers offer scalable and flexible solutions for hosting web applications. They provide various services including virtual machines, storage, databases, and more. Some of the most popular providers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>: AWS offers a comprehensive suite of cloud services, including EC2 for virtual servers, S3 for storage, and RDS for managed databases. Its scalability and range of services make it a go-to choice for many developers.</li>

<p>Containers allow developers to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments (this simplifies deployment processes by ensuring your app always gets deployed into the same system). Orchestration tools manage and scale these containers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Docker is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, making it easier to manage application dependencies and environments.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong>: Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration tool for managing containerized applications at scale. It automates deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers, providing a solid infrastructure for large-scale applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serverless-architecture">Serverless Architecture</h3>
<p>If you just don’t want to think about the server, at all (configuration, specs, resource requirements, etc), then you probably want a serverless architecture.</p>
<p>Serverless architecture allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure (the servers are there, you just don’t interact directly with them). Key benefits include automatic scaling and pay-per-use billing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWS Lambda</strong>: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes code in response to events and automatically scales based on the number of requests, making it ideal for microservices and real-time data processing.</li>
<li><strong>Google Cloud Functions</strong>: Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. It allows you to write simple, single-purpose functions that are triggered by events.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Functions</strong>: Azure Functions provides a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-triggered code. It integrates with other Azure services, offering a seamless development and deployment experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-iac">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
<p>IaC allows developers to manage and provision computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This is a great option if you’re looking to version your infrastructure configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terraform</strong>: Terraform is an IaC tool that allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It supports multiple cloud providers, making it a versatile choice for managing infrastructure. While not fully open-source, Terraform offers a paid version called Terraform Cloud. If you’re looking for a fully open-source version, you can look into OpenTofu, which is an open-source fork from Terraform under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.</li>
<li><strong>Ansible</strong>: Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses YAML and doesn’t require agent software on the target nodes, making it easy to use and manage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer">A step-by-step guide on how to become a full stack developer</h2>
<p>Learning full stack development can be a lot to handle. There is so much material—tutorials, blogs, videos—that it can be hard to find where to begin and what resources to rely on. Thankfully, you can make use of the step-by-step <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">full stack development</a> roadmap to learn and track your progress.</p>
<p>The full stack development guide provides clear explanations of all the necessary concepts. The steps below present a concise explanation of the full stack developer roadmap.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-nd2r3.png" alt="A step-by-step guide on how to become a full stack developer"></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Learn the basics of frontend development.</strong>
<a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">Learning frontend development</a> basics is important to becoming a successful full stack developer. Frontend development involves making a website look good, responsive, and user-friendly. It is the client side of web development, focusing on how web elements (forms, buttons, etc.) appear on a screen.</p>
<p>Frontend developers depend on three important languages to create interactive websites and applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypertext markup languages <strong>(HTML)</strong>.</li>
<li>Cascading style sheets <strong>(CSS)</strong>.</li>
<li>JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML and CSS go hand in hand when it comes to web development. HTML serves as the foundation for building web pages. It helps structure and organize the web elements of websites and applications. Examples of these web elements include images, headings, texts, links, and videos. CSS improves the visual appeal of the web elements. It allows you to control the user interface, add colors and spaces, and more using CSS selectors and IDs.</p>
<p>If you want to improve at HTML and CSS, use them to build projects. Do not only focus on studying; build and practice simultaneously. This approach will help you understand
HTML and CSS well. Some project ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and design a resume that shows off your work experience.</li>
<li>Create a responsive landing page for any product.</li>
<li>Create a personal website or a blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a> is a programming language used to make your website functional and interactive. It makes web elements like buttons, forms, and animations on your website work. To practice JavaScript, try building:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple calculator.</li>
<li>An interactive quiz application.</li>
<li>A to-do list application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is important to becoming a full stack developer. They work together to create static, interactive web pages that users engage with.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Learn frontend web development frameworks and libraries.</strong>
Learning frameworks and libraries are the next step to becoming a full stack developer. Frontend web frameworks and libraries make it easier to create web interfaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend/frameworks" target="_blank">Frontend frameworks</a> allow users to create websites and applications in a structured manner. They offer pre-written codes and templates to make the development process easier. This way, you won’t have to start from scratch and can focus on making your application stand out. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a>, Tailwind CSS, Svelte, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/vue" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> are a few examples of popular frontend web frameworks.</p>
<p>In contrast, frontend libraries are pre-written codes that perform specific functionalities. They help expand on what frameworks can do, or you can use them alone for particular tasks. Some examples of these tasks include form validation, animation, and data visualization. Animate.css, Chart.js, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/react" target="_blank">React</a> are a few examples of popular frontend libraries.</p>
<p>Frameworks and libraries work together to make development easier in different ways. For example, the <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> framework helps with responsive web design and layout. But if you want to spice things up with fancy animations, you can use a library like <strong>Animate.css</strong>. They work together to help you make web designs that are useful and look good at the same time.</p>
<p>Try building your own projects to understand how these frameworks and libraries work. It doesn’t matter how simple these projects are; study and build projects. Some examples of projects to build include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-page applications <strong>(SPAs)</strong> like game applications.</li>
<li>Responsive personal portfolio website.</li>
</ul>
<p>These projects will help you understand and get better at different concepts. You must practice often and work on real projects to get good at using frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Understand version control systems</strong>
The knowledge of version control systems <strong>(VCS)</strong> is important for full stack developers. VCS records every change made to your codebase, so you know who changed what, when, and why. Being able to do this is vital when working with experienced developers on the same project.</p>
<p>Some popular examples of VCS include Git <strong>(GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket)</strong>. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/git-github" target="_blank">GitHub</a> lets you collaborate, store, and share your code using Git repositories. VCS has many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps full stack developers collaborate without facing difficulties.</li>
<li>It helps full stack developers try new ideas without fear of ruining the code.</li>
<li>It saves a copy of your code so you can return to an earlier version if you have to.</li>
<li>It provides access control and authentication. You can control who can edit, review, or manage your code. It keeps your code safe and tidy when working with other professional developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing how to use VCS is important to become a full stack developer. It improves collaboration and helps organize difficult projects. This documentation contains everything you need to know about <a href="https://github.com/git-guides" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Git</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Learn backend web development</strong>
Now that you know frontend concepts, it is time to <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">learn backend web development</a>. Backend development is the process of building the server side of web applications. It is where the behind-the-scenes operations that make the frontend interface work happen. This part of server-side development focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management of databases.</li>
<li>Application programming interfaces <strong>(APIs)</strong> development.</li>
<li>Server-side logic and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Backend developers create applications using different backend programming languages and frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/nodejs" target="_blank">Node.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a></li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank">Java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These backend programming languages have specific strengths and weaknesses. Choosing a language comes down to what the project needs, what your team is good at, and what you like.</p>
<p>If you are looking to start backend development, I recommend learning Node.js. Node.js runs on JavaScript, which is the primary language for backend development. Since you already know JavaScript from the frontend, it will be easy to learn. Node.js allows you to build dynamic backend applications using JavaScript. So, you can work across the whole tech stack <strong>(both the frontend and backend)</strong> using one language.</p>
<p>Node.js has many cool packages and libraries; you can get them through the Node Package Manager <strong>(NPM)</strong>. These resources provide existing solutions like authentication with OAuth for everyday tasks. You can also use Node.js on any operating system, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>It is important to practice as you learn to understand how it works better. Think about working on projects that combine your frontend abilities with backend features. Practice Node.js by building basic CRUD <strong>(Create, Read, Update, Delete)</strong> applications, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media applications, e.g., Twitter.</li>
<li>Project management applications, e.g., Jira.</li>
<li>Online shopping websites, e.g., Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building CRUD applications will teach you how to handle and work with databases. As you continue learning, build more complex applications that combine different functionalities. For example, you can create a project with user authentication to log in and sign up for an application.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most important concepts to focus on when learning Node.js:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database interactions</strong>: <a href="https://roadmap.sh/mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CRUD operations.</li>
<li><strong>File and module system</strong>: Reading and writing files, local vs. global modules, NPM.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous programming</strong>: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await syntax, event emitters, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Event loop</strong>: Task queues, event listeners, handling of I/O operations.</li>
<li><strong>Express.js framework</strong>: routing, middleware, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), RESTful APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication and security</strong>: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth implementation, Security best practices, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>After learning Node.js and its ecosystem, you can move on to <a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank"><strong>Java</strong></a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank"><strong>Python</strong></a>, C#, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/golang" target="_blank"><strong>Go</strong></a>, Ruby or <a href="https://roadmap.sh/rust" target="_blank"><strong>Rust</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Understanding the differences between these languages will help you choose the best tool.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As you keep learning more tools, you will realize there is too much to learn, and you can never know everything. I advise you to get very good at using one tool <strong>(such as Node.js)</strong> and have a basic understanding of others. Keep improving using that one tool, and you will be good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Learn DevOps and deployment basics</strong>
To be a skilled full stack developer, you must know your way around DevOps and deployment. DevOps combines software development and IT operations to improve software delivery. It makes developing, managing, and deploying applications a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>The first step in <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">learning DevOps</a> is to learn about Linux basics, cloud services, and CI/CD pipelines. These skills are important for deploying and managing software applications. The following are areas you should focus on when learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux basics</strong>: Learn Linux, file systems, networking, and security.</li>
<li><strong>Version control systems</strong>: Learn to use <a href="https://roadmap.sh/git-github" target="_blank">Git</a> to manage code and collaborate.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud services</strong>: Learn about <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">AWS</a>, Azure, or Google Cloud.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>: Learn testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>: Learn tools like Terraform for infrastructure automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you have an understanding of these basics, it’s time to put your new skills into practice. First, try deploying your full stack applications to cloud platforms like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">AWS</a> or Heroku. This will help you get real experience managing and maintaining live applications. You can start with easy applications and work up to harder ones.</p>
<p>Next, you will learn about automation and monitoring when working on your projects. GitHub Actions and Ansible are useful tools for this purpose. They assist in automating development, deployment, and configuration tasks. Knowing these DevOps concepts will help you handle the demands of full stack development.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Network and consistently learn more.</strong>
Building your full stack developer skills requires consistent learning and networking. It involves spending time self-learning, building friendships, and growing skill sets. The tips below will help you learn and network better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take online courses and watch online tutorials to understand full stack development concepts better.</li>
<li>Read books and articles about web development, programming languages, and software engineering.</li>
<li>Contribute to open-source projects to gain experience and develop relationships with full stack professionals.</li>
<li>Join communities like the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/cJpEt5Qbwa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap community</a> to learn from other professional developers.</li>
<li>Attend conferences, meetups, and online forums to learn from industry professionals.</li>
<li>Take part in coding challenges and hackathons to practice and learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent learning and networking will help you become a better full stack developer. It will help you succeed, keep up with the latest technologies, and solve coding problems.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Build a portfolio and apply for jobs</strong>
As a developer, you work on projects to improve your skill set and get a full stack developer job. But to show off these projects to a hiring manager, you must have them all in one place. For this reason, it is important to have a portfolio if you want to become a full stack developer.</p>
<p>Portfolios are compilations of your best work that showcase your skills and experiences. It is like a resume, but instead of bullet points listing your coding skills, it shows you pictures and more work details. Among the many benefits of owning a portfolio are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It shows a hiring manager that you can do the job, not just talk about it.</li>
<li>It shows your full stack developer skills across both old and new technologies.</li>
<li>It sets you apart from other developers who have similar qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating your portfolio, include projects that show your skills with different tools. The following are some project ideas to add to your portfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal projects</strong>: Examples of these applications can be budgeting or recipe applications.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source contributions</strong>: Add links to your open-source contributions.</li>
<li><strong>Full</strong> <strong>**</strong>stack applications**: Create applications that show off your frontend and backend development skills. An example of this application is an online shopping website with user authentication.</li>
<li><strong>API development</strong>: Build and include RESTFUL APIs in your portfolio. It will show off your skills in the back-end, working with Node.js and other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have built a portfolio, it is time to start job hunting for full stack development jobs. This involves creating a resume and cover letter and prepping for interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To become a full stack developer, you must create the habit of always learning. So, if you get the job or not, it doesn’t matter; you have to keep learning and improving your coding skills.</p>
<p>While a portfolio is not always required when applying for full stack development jobs, it’s a good idea to start building one. However, when you first start applying for jobs, a GitHub profile with your key projects may be enough; you can use pinned repositories to display your best work. With time, you can create your full stack developer portfolio to display your projects.</p>
<h2 id="responsibilities-of-a-full-stack-developer">Responsibilities of a full stack developer</h2>

<h2 id="adaptability">Adaptability</h2>
<p>Open-source and research activities have constantly changed the web development ecosystem. Full stack developers must be willing to learn new technologies, know when to build from scratch or use third-party solutions, and adapt to changing project requirements.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-backend-development">What is Backend development?</h2>
<p>Unlike full stack development, which combines the roles of frontend developers and backend developers to build applications, backend web development focuses solely on the server side. Backend developers handle tasks that occur behind the scenes and are not directly visible to users, including managing data, executing complex logic, and managing databases.</p>
<p>Backend development is divided into the presentation layer(which handles requests and responses), the business layer(which handles logic like calculation and data processing), and the data access layer (which handles database interactions). It uses server-side technologies similar to a full stack developer.</p>
<h2 id="similarities-between-full-stack-and-backend-development">Similarities between Full stack and Backend development</h2>
<p>Full stack and backend development share several similarities as they both work on the server side of the application. Below are some key similarities in the web development process between full stack and backend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both work on server-side functionality, such as business logic, database interaction, and data processing.</li>
<li>Design and implement APIs to facilitate communication between software components.</li>
<li>Both ensure the security and integrity of user data.</li>
<li>Collaborate with other team members and business stakeholders to ensure project success.</li>
<li>Both handle errors, edge cases, and other difficult technical aspects of the application.</li>
<li>Both are involved in designing and architecting scalable systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-development-in-the-modern-era-full-stack-vs-backend">Web development in the modern era: Full stack vs Backend</h2>
<p>While the web’s possibilities are exciting and fascinating, they have also changed the roles and responsibilities of developers building applications for it. Let’s consider the points below as a case study of how these changes might affect full stack and backend development:</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>While full stack development’s role and responsibilities are collaborative in nature compared to the specialized focus of backend development, the current innovative trend will further heighten the demand for collaboration. Full stack developers will increasingly collaborate with various stakeholders to build performant and dynamic applications. This may also require backend developers to expand their role beyond their traditional domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/collaboration-7sg14.png" alt="Collaboration"></p>
<h2 id="versatility">Versatility</h2>
<p>As the web offers more opportunities, organizations will migrate their core applications from native platforms to web-based solutions, necessitating developers to embrace versatility and acquire new skills.</p>
<p>For full stack web developers who already navigate both frontend and backend development fields, they are well-positioned to adapt to changing demands by acquiring additional skills to meet business needs and project requirements. Similarly, backend developers may need to adjust their roles and embrace expanded responsibilities that extend beyond their domain-specific tasks to leverage the possibilities presented by this transition fully.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/versatility-surv2.png" alt="Versatility"></p>

<p>Let me take you through each role so you see what they’re like and I’ll help you decide which is best suited to your ambitions and interest.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-a-full-stack-developer">Who is a full stack developer?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">full stack developer</a> also known as a full stack programmer possesses the knowledge and technical skill sets to work proficiently in a software application’s front-end and back-end.</p>
<p>An application’s front-end encompasses everything the user can see while interacting with it, i.e., the user interface. The back-end of a web application consists of the server-side programming, the database, and the server.  Full stack developers typically are responsible for building the front-end and back-end of software applications.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at both the front-end and back-end in greater detail.</p>
<h3 id="front-end-development">Front-end development</h3>
<p>It refers to everything a user can see and interact with. It is also known as the client side of an application. It is concerned primarily with the client-side development, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).</p>
<p>The common programming languages used in front-end development by a full stack developer include HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. HTML defines the markup of the web page. CSS builds upon HTML and represents the style and format of the webpage. JavaScript is a programming language often used for front-end development and adds logic to your web page. You’ll find an excellent guide and roadmap to learning <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> on our platform.</p>
<p>There are quite a few front-end web development frameworks out there used by full stack developers. Some of the common ones are <a href="https://roadmap.sh/react" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/vue" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a>. You can look at the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner" target="_blank">front-end beginners roadmap</a> or the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend" target="_blank">advanced front-end roadmap</a> for a more detailed guide.</p>
<h3 id="back-end-development">Back-end development</h3>
<p>It includes everything the user <em>cannot</em> see. It is sometimes referred to as the server side of an application. It focuses on the application’s functionality and <em>business logic</em>. Examples of back-end components include data storage, security, and handling of business logic.</p>
<p>Back end development mainly involves creating API endpoints consumed by the application’s front-end. Backend developers usually work with languages such as Python , Java , or Ruby , along with frameworks like Node.js , Django , or Ruby on Rails. Check out the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">back-end developer</a> roadmap.</p>
<h3 id="full-stack-developers-skills">Full stack developers’ skills</h3>

<h2 id="who-is-a-software-engineer">Who is a software engineer?</h2>
<p>A software engineer is a specialist with a deep understanding of software development, computer systems, and programming languages. A software engineer designs and creates software programs and web applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>Software engineers are specialists who focus on a specific aspect of software development. A software engineer produces high quality software solutions and ensures high software performance. They can specialize in parts of development such as database management, web development, mobile development and more.</p>
<p>There are two primary types of software engineers: applications and systems software engineers.</p>
<h3 id="application-software-engineers">Application software engineers</h3>
<p>An application software engineer is also known as s client-focused software engineer. These software engineers design and develop software applications users interact with.</p>
<p>An application software engineer could be a front-end engineer, a back-end engineer, or full-stack software engineer. They also develop applications for operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and many more.</p>
<h3 id="systems-software-engineers">Systems software engineers</h3>
<p>These software engineers develop systems and networks that drive the user-facing applications developed by the application software engineers. A system software engineer is a specialist in either hardware or software engineering or both.</p>
<p>System software engineers can also integrate different software products into a single platform; for example, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> engineers can use tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy and orchestrate applications.</p>
<p>System software engineers often serve as IT or system architects or backend software developers who design, test software and enforce industry tech standards. A system software engineer is an expert in software design and mostly design back-end systems and operating system that users do not directly interact with.</p>
<p>Software systems are complex, and much thought goes into building them. Software engineers use their broad knowledge of coding languages and engineering principles to break down these complex systems and build software.</p>
<p>The usual software project development and management life cycle looks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They design the whole system, typically employing the principles of <a href="https://roadmap.sh/system-design" target="_blank">system design</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture" target="_blank">software design architecture</a>. They decide on the software architecture to use for the application by weighing the pros and cons of different system architectures that might be suitable. Some standard architectures are monolith architecture, micro-services architecture, event-driven architecture, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After deciding on the system architecture, the next step is defining the tools. The tools include programming languages, database management, version control, and cloud systems (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">Amazon AWS</a>). Several factors affect the choice of the tools: existing knowledge and expertise, cost, suitability of the tools to the application, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After choosing the tools, the next step is to define the different entities and their relationships. This is usually done with an expert experienced in the domain where the application to be built will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building the system involves several iterations. Still, the target is usually to produce the minimum viable product (MVP), the application’s basic functionalities. A lot of software testing is done by quality assurance personnel and the application’s users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is important to note that this entire process is iterative.</strong></p>
<h3 id="software-engineers-skills">Software engineers skills</h3>
<p>The following core technical skills and soft skills are required for the software engineering role:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of <a href="https://roadmap.sh/computer-science" target="_blank">computer science fundamentals</a>, software development, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/system-design" target="_blank">system design</a>.</li>
<li>Knowledge of at least one of the common programming languages</li>
<li>Strong analytical and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>Knowledge of operating systems</li>
<li>Understanding of networks and security</li>
<li>Knowledge of cloud platforms and DevOps systems</li>
<li>Knowledge of testing e.g. unit testing, integration test, end-to-end test</li>
<li>Well-versed in debugging processes/systems</li>
<li>Project management skills</li>
<li>Technical support skills</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Focus and expertise</li>
<li>Accessibility and entry point</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="focus-and-expertise">Focus and expertise</h3>
<p>Full-stack developers have broad expertise. Full-stack developers are experts in both front-end and back end development. The opposite is the case for software engineers in practice. Software engineers specialize in a particular field and thus typically have a deeper, more specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>A software engineer could focus on only front-end development and have extensive knowledge of that aspect while a full-stack developer focuses on the overall software lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility-and-entry-point">Accessibility and entry point</h3>
<p>Two major pathways exist to becoming a full-stack developer or software engineer: self-taught and a formal education with a degree.</p>
<p>For the formal pathway, you will be taught and develop a strong computer science background, which is the core of software development and web development. Self-taught full stack developers and software engineers learn specific, industry-relevant skills on their own time.</p>
<p>One advantage of the formal education path is gaining hands-on full stack development and software engineering experience while studying through internships.</p>
<h2 id="common-full-stack-developer-and-software-engineer-skills">Common full stack developer and software engineer skills</h2>

<p>Which is better for enterprise-grade systems, Go or Java? Which technology accelerates productivity in large-scale development? Which frameworks provide the most adaptability when tackling modern software challenges? These are the questions developers and tech leads often wrestle with, drawing on personal experiences, industry trends, and the need to keep up with ever-changing application demands.</p>
<p>As someone with experience building high-performance systems and working extensively with both <a href="https://roadmap.sh/golang" target="_blank">Go</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank">Java</a>, I understand the debate developers often face when choosing between these two powerful languages. Java has long been the go-to choice for robust, enterprise-level applications, and it is known for its maturity and extensive ecosystem. Meanwhile, Go has steadily risen in popularity and is celebrated for its simplicity, speed, and ability to handle scalable, high-performance systems easily.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through the key features of both Go and Java, including their performance, memory management, and adoption rates. I’ll also offer guidance on when to choose Go or Java for your next project.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the key features of Go and Java:</p>

































































<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Feature</strong></th><th><strong>Go</strong></th><th><strong>Java</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Compiled language to native code</td><td>Compiled to bytecode, runs on the JVM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Concurrency Model</strong></td><td>Goroutines (lightweight threads, managed by Go runtime)</td><td>Threads (OS-level, managed by JVM)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory Management</strong></td><td>Garbage collection, with manual memory management options</td><td>Automatic garbage collection (JVM)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Syntax</strong></td><td>Simple, concise, inspired by C</td><td>Verbose, object oriented language</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>High due to direct compilation to machine code</td><td>Good, but can be slower due to the JVM layer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cross-Platform</strong></td><td>Compiles to native binaries, runs on multiple platforms</td><td>JVM provides cross-platform compatibility</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Error Handling</strong></td><td>Explicit error handling via return values</td><td>Exceptions (try-catch mechanism)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Learning Curve</strong></td><td>Lower due to simpler syntax and fewer features</td><td>Steeper, especially for new developers due to verbosity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use Cases</strong></td><td>System programming, microservices, cloud-native apps, DevOps</td><td>Enterprise applications, Android development, large-scale apps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Community &#x26; Libraries</strong></td><td>Growing, especially for cloud-native and system tools</td><td>Mature, large ecosystem with extensive libraries and frameworks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scalability</strong></td><td>Excellent for highly concurrent and lightweight applications</td><td>Scalable, but can be more resource-intensive</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Before looking at these features in detail, let’s take a closer look at these two programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="go">Go</h2>
<p><a href="https://go.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Go</a>, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. Since its release in 2009, Go has gained massive adoption in building REST APIs, system programming, cloud computing, and microservices architecture, thanks to its focus on simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.</p>
<p>As a statically typed language, Go allows you to catch errors early and build software faster. It also has a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
<p>Go comes with extensive tools and libraries for building small to large-scale applications.</p>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.java.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Java</a> is a high-level, object-oriented programming language owned and maintained by the Oracle Corporation. It is known for scalability, extensibility, and portability, which has made it a leading choice for building enterprise-grade applications, Android app development, and web applications.</p>
<p>James Gosling first developed Java at Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, and it introduced the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA) principle. This means Java code can be compiled and run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, irrespective of the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Java also has robust tools and libraries that make writing code easy and help you build small to large-scale applications.</p>
<p>Both Go and Java are server-side programming languages for building high-performance applications. You may wonder which language is superior and what considerations should guide your choice. Let’s dive deep into the side-by-side comparison of these two languages.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Golang outperforms Java and is often compared to high-performance programming languages like C or C++ because it compiles into native machine code. For high-intensive operations like I/O bound and CPU-heavy tasks, Go outperforms Java because it doesn’t have the JVM overhead.</p>
<p>Java’s performance has also improved over the years when used in mission-critical applications and can be competitive with Go, but the major drawback is the JVM layer. It uses more memory, which can impact performance when used in a constrained environment like containers and microservices.</p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-development">Cross-platform development</h2>
<p>Go compiles binary files separately for each platform, which means you can run it directly on platforms like Linux and macOS without requiring additional software. Java is also platform-independent because any application written in Java can run on any system with JVM installed and supports bytecode portability.</p>
<p>While both Go and Java enable cross-compilation and can run on multiple platforms, Java offers more comprehensive coverage. Java has massive support on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile (Android and iOS via frameworks), servers, and embedded systems via Java ME. Go, on the other hand, has limited compatibility with mobile and embedded systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/go-vs-java-in-cross-platform-development-q5eff.png" alt="Go vs. Java in Cross-platform development"></p>
<h2 id="community-and-ecosystem">Community and ecosystem</h2>
<p>Java has a more mature and established community with many tools, libraries, and frameworks. It powers a significant portion of enterprise applications and has battle-tested frameworks like Spring, Apache Kafka, and much more.</p>
<p>In comparison, Go’s community is relatively young but also growing. It has made significant progress in the cloud-native space with projects like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/terraform" target="_blank">Terrafoam</a> powering enterprise applications.</p>

<h2 id="memory-management">Memory management</h2>
<p>One of the unique features of Go is not just the in-built garbage collection (GC) that automatically frees up unused memory. Additionally, Go provides more control by allowing developers to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation. However, manual memory management comes at a cost, as you have to take care of edge cases and handle potential memory leaks.</p>
<p>Java on the other hand, also has automatic GC without the option of manually managing memory. The GC in Java has seen massive improvement, especially for large enterprise systems, but it can still show some lags when building low-latency systems like trading platforms.</p>
<h2 id="type-and-compilation">Type and compilation</h2>
<p>Go and Java are statically typed languages, which means their data types are determined at compile time before the program executes. So, when you develop your application in either of these languages, you detect errors early and improve code readability and reliability.</p>
<p>Go compiles directly into machine code that can be executed by the operating system, which makes it faster as there’s no intermediate layer. In contrast, Java compiles to bytecode that uses a JVM as an intermediary, which introduces an overhead, as compared to Go’s native compilation.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>Go and Java are powerful languages with distinct approaches to handling errors. Go favors explicit error handling, where you have to think about error handling at each step, which can be verbose, repetitive, and missing some benefits of a structured approach to error handling.</p>

<h2 id="learning-curve">Learning curve</h2>
<p>Go has a relatively low learning curve compared to Java due to its simple syntax, standard library, and fewer language features. It is easy for beginners to pick up due to the language’s conciseness and limited ways to perform tasks. However, Go lacks some robust features like operator overloading and inheritance found in other languages, which can limit your expressiveness when building applications.</p>
<p>Java, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve. It can be difficult for beginners to pick up because of its verbosity and comprehensive features. While Java’s syntax is evolving and introducing improvements (like Lambda and functional paradigm) to address some of the concerns, beginners still need to learn design principles like object-oriented programming (OOP) and many more.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>Go’s efficiency, simplicity, and concurrent pattern make it an ideal choice for building cloud-native applications, network programming, and DevOps tools (like automation scripts and command line tools). Some notable companies actively using Go include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google uses Go extensively for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/go" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">infrastructure</a>, data processing, and various internal projects.</li>
<li>Docker uses Go to build its containerization platform.</li>
<li>Dropbox uses Go to build its infrastructure and <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/open-sourcing-our-go-libraries" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">file synchronization feature.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Java is also widely used for developing enterprise applications, Android development, data processing, and large-scale web applications. Its stable and mature ecosystem makes it an ideal choice for enterprise solutions. Some notable companies actively using Java include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix uses Java for its <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-java/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">streaming platform</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>While the points above cover some notable features of both Go and Java, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each language, you may still be wondering which one to choose for your next project. Not to worry, that question will be addressed in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="which-one-should-you-choose">Which one should you choose?</h2>
<p>Well, as any diplomatic developer might say, ‘It depends.’ Both Go and Java are excellent programming languages, and your choice between them depends on the type of project you want to build, ecosystem support, and other important factors. Let’s explore these factors in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Go is a great choice for projects that handle multiple users or require background tasks without interrupting the user experience. Its high concurrency and performance make it ideal for such scenarios. However, if your project needs complex functionalities and a broad ecosystem of tools, Java may be a better option.</p>
<p><strong>Career and Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to carefully evaluate your end goal. If you aim to build a project to demonstrate proof of work, showcase your experience, or secure a job, consider the industry you’re targeting and decide based on the opportunities there. For example, if you want to work in corporate sectors like fintech, insurance, or banking, Java might be an ideal choice because of its capability to build enterprise-grade applications. However, if you’re aiming for industries focused on cloud infrastructure, Go is often a better choice than Java.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/average-java-developer-salary-in-the-us-goqr1.png" alt="Average Java developer salary in the US"></p>
<p><strong>Target Platform</strong></p>
<p>If you’re building for mobile and web platforms, Java offers strong support for applications ranging from small-scale projects to large enterprise solutions, thanks to its proven tools, libraries, and frameworks that you can easily leverage. However, if your target platform is cloud and cloud-native environments, Go might be a better choice due to its extensive ecosystem and robust features.</p>
<p>Choosing between Go and Java largely depends on the factors mentioned above. However, you might also wonder if there are similarities between these languages and whether there’s an intersection where using both could be beneficial. Well, you guessed right. Let’s explore that next.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-both-go-and-java">When to use both Go and Java</h2>
<p>Both Java and Go are popular programming languages that share similarities like static typing, concurrent handling, GC, platform independence, strong ecosystems, and standard libraries, which make them powerful languages that can be combined for building applications. Below are some scenarios where you can combine the strengths of both Go and Java to build applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microservices architecture.</li>
<li>Web development with high-performance requirements.</li>
<li>Data processing pipelines.</li>
<li>Cloud-native applications with diverse microservices.</li>
<li>Cross-platform mobile and desktop full stack applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/when-to-use-both-go-and-java-wr4rs.png" alt="Go and Java combination"></p>
<p><strong>Microservices architecture</strong></p>
<p>If you’re building a high-performance microservices system for an e-commerce platform, you can leverage Java’s maturity and enterprise-grade ecosystem to build the core backend processes handling complex business logic, such as payment transactions, inventory management, and order processing.</p>
<p>Then, use Go to build services that require high performance and fast execution, like a real-time recommendation system, caching mechanism, and notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Web development with high-performance requirements</strong></p>
<p>A real-time social media analytic platform and a stock exchange trading platform are examples of web applications that require high performance because they handle a massive amount of data. You can use Go for real-time data collection and event-driven activities that capture user engagement data, shares, and likes.</p>
<p>Then, Java can be used to manage the backend workflow, such as storing and aggregating data.</p>
<p><strong>Data processing pipelines</strong></p>
<p>If you’re building a real-time analytic platform that involves processing and analyzing large volumes of data, then you can use Go to process data ingestion and transformation. Go’s goroutines make it an ideal language for data ingestion and preprocessing.</p>
<p>Use Java-based data-intensive frameworks like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark for data processing and analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud-native applications with diverse microservices</strong></p>
<p>If you’re building a Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud monitoring tool for cloud infrastructure, you can use Go to build your application microservices that handle real-time monitoring, metric collection, and data scraping from different cloud services. Java, on the other hand, can be used to power the backend features like billing, user management, and data reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform mobile and desktop full stack application</strong></p>
<p>An example of cross-platform mobile and desktop full stack application is a platform for visualizing financial data with a backend analytic engine. In such cases, you can use Java to build the desktop and mobile application logic and user interface due to its cross-platform capabilities.</p>
<p>Use Go to build the backend analytic engine with real-time data processing and expose the services using REST APIs to the Java mobile and desktop client.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Go is an excellent choice for building high-performance, lightweight applications that require concurrency, such as cloud-native applications and microservices. Java, on the other hand, has a mature ecosystem with battle-tested tools, libraries, and frameworks, which makes it a powerful option for building large-scale enterprise applications where scalability and robustness are essential.</p>
<p>Choosing between Go and Java depends on the type of project you want to build, the platform you’re targeting, and the ecosystem you want to adopt for your project. Regardless of your choice, you can use the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/golang" target="_blank">Go roadmap</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank">Java roadmap</a> to stay up to date with the latest changes in each language.</p>`,zi={title:"Go vs Java: Choosing the Right Language for Your Projects",description:"Comparing Go vs Java for your projects?

<p>Building a REST API in <a href="https://roadmap.sh/golang" target="_blank">Go</a> offers a blend of high performance, ease of deployment, and scalability. Go’s efficient runtime and built-in concurrency model make it an ideal choice for building applications that handle large volumes of requests while still maintaining low latency. With a robust standard library and supportive ecosystem, you can quickly implement REST functionality into your applications.</p>
<p>Since its official release in 2009, Go has gained massive adoption and is gradually becoming the go-to technology for building applications, from small-scale to mission-critical systems. Its adoption surged even further when industry leaders used it to power containerization and orchestration tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. Whether you’re building a small service or a mission-critical application, Go provides a powerful foundation for REST API development.</p>
<p>Given these advantages, let’s put Go’s capabilities into practice. In this guide, you will build a basic bookkeeping management API that supports create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionalities. You’ll also write unit tests for these functionalities to ensure they work as intended, implement authentication to secure the APIs, and create comprehensive documentation.</p>
<p>Let’s get started building the application.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-project-set-up">Step 1: Project set up</h2>
<p>To get started, use your terminal to create a project directory.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">mkdir</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> go_book_api</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> &#x26;&#x26; </span><span style="color:#8BE9FD">cd</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> go_book_api</span></span></code></pre>
<p>These commands create a directory called <code>go_book_api</code> and navigate into it.</p>
<p>Next, initialize a <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Go module</a> within the project.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-structuring-the-project">Step 2: Structuring the project</h2>
<p>While Go doesn’t enforce how you should structure your project, it is essential you have a good structure when building an application with Go. It makes your codebase easy to maintain and clear for others to understand.</p>
<p>To structure your project, create an <code>api</code>, <code>cmd</code>, and <code>tests</code> folders.</p>
<p><code>api</code> is for organizing API development-related files.
<code>cmd</code> is used to organize the application entry point. This is a convention within the Go community.
<code>tests</code> are for organizing unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-implement-crud-operations-for-the-bookkeeping-application">Step 3: Implement CRUD operations for the bookkeeping application</h2>
<p>Create an <code>api/model.go</code> file to structure the application’s data and response.</p>

<p>The code snippet above creates a <code>Book</code> and <code>JsonResponse</code> structs with the required properties using struct tags (e.g., <code>json:"title"</code>) and a helper function <code>ResponseJSON</code> to manage API responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The struct tag lets you send responses that fit into the JSON naming convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="create-a-new-book">Create a new book</h3>
<p>To create a new book handler function, create an <code>api/handlers.go</code> file that will contain the application business logic. It’s important to separate the business logic from the data model, as it helps deliver scalable, maintainable, and testable code.</p>

<h2 id="adding-authentication-to-the-rest-apis">Adding authentication to the REST APIs</h2>
<p>An integral part of building a robust API is the authentication mechanism. It verifies the identity of a user or system using your API. When you have authentication set up in your API, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources or data.</li>
<li>Control the level of access.</li>
<li>Track and log who accessed the API and what actions they performed.</li>
<li>Tailored responses or experiences for authenticated users.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Go, you can implement authentication using any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON Web Tokens (JWT).</li>
<li>OAuth 2.0.</li>
<li>Session-based authentication.</li>
<li>API Keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this project, you’ll use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure the API. The process begins with a user providing their credentials, such as a username and password. The system then verifies these credentials and issues a token, which the user can use to access protected endpoints.</p>
<p>To get started, install the JWT package.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">go</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> get</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -u</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-middleware">Create a middleware</h3>
<p>Middlewares are functions or modules that intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the final route handler or after the response leaves the handler. In this case, you want to check that the request has the right token before accessing any of the endpoints.</p>
<p>To do this, first update your <code>.env</code> file with a secret token. The token ensures the security, authenticity, and integrity of the tokens.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>SECRET_TOKEN=&#x3C;REPLACE WITH A RANDOM LONG STRING></span></span></code></pre>

<h2 id="adding-documentation-to-the-rest-apis">Adding documentation to the REST APIs</h2>
<p>Documentation is an integral part of your APIs. It helps you communicate intent and help others understand, maintain, and utilize your APIs effectively. Documentation can be in the form of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical documentation</strong> that guides developers on APIs, configurations, and architecture of the system.</li>
<li><strong>User manual</strong> that helps end-users understand how to use the product.</li>
<li><strong>Internal documentation</strong> that captures internal processes, workflows, and other operational details.</li>
<li><strong>Code comments</strong> that provide inline explanations of specific sections of the codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Go, you have access to a variety of tools when it comes to generating, maintaining, and displaying documentation. Below are some of the widely used ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>GoDoc</li>
<li>pkg.go.dev</li>
<li>go doc</li>
<li>godocdown</li>
<li>Swagger/OpenAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>In this project, you’ll use GoDoc to add documentation.</p>
<p>To get started, first update the <a href="https://go.dev/dl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Go version</a> based on your operating system. Then, install the GoDoc package using the command below:</p>

<p>Next, modify the <code>handlers.rs</code> file and add comments to describe what each helper function and handlers do.</p>

<p>Go’s simplicity, built-in concurrency, cloud-native features, and performance make it a popular choice among developers. The growing ecosystem and community support also ensure that you have the right tools and libraries to build and maintain RESTful APIs efficiently and any other application you want to build.</p>
<p>Apart from the Gin framework, Go also has popular web frameworks like Echo, Revel, and many more for building APIs.

Fast-forward to today, 10 years later, if you look at it rings truer than ever. JavaScript is continuing to gain more and more adoption.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-is-announced">JavaScript is announced</h3>
<p>JavaScript was initially created by <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a> of Netscape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially it was named <code>Mocha</code> by the creator, which was later renamed to <code>LiveScript</code>. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to be <code>JavaScript</code> with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="es1-es2-and-es3">ES1, ES2 and ES3</h3>
<p>In 1996, Netscape decided to submit it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ECMA International</a> with the hopes of getting it standardized. First edition of the standard specification was released in 1997 and the language was standardized. After the initial release, <code>ECMAScript</code> was continued to be worked upon and in no-time two more versions were released ECMAScript 2 in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in 1999.</p>
<h3 id="decade-of-silence-and-es4">Decade of Silence and ES4</h3>
<p>After the release of ES3 in 1999, there was a complete silence for a decade and no changes were made to the official standard. There was some work on the fourth edition in the initial days; some of the features that were being discussed included classes, modules, static typings, destructuring etc. It was being targeted to be released by 2008 but was abandoned due to political differences concerning language complexity. However, the vendors kept introducing the extensions to the language and the developers were left scratching their heads — adding polyfills to battle compatibility issues between different browsers.</p>
<h3 id="from-silence-to-es5">From silence to ES5</h3>
<p>Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and other disputers of ES4 came together and decided to work on a less ambitious update to ES3 tentatively named ES3.1. But the teams were still fighting about what to include from ES4 and what not. Finally, in 2009 ES5 was released mainly focusing on fixing the compatibility and security issues etc. But there wasn’t much of a splash in the water — it took ages for the vendors to incorporate the standards and many developers were still using ES3 without being aware of the “modern” standards.</p>
<h3 id="release-of-es6--ecmascript-2015">Release of ES6 — ECMAScript 2015</h3>
<p>After a few years of the release of ES5, things started to change, TC39 (the committee under ECMA international responsible for ECMAScript standardization) kept working on the next version of ECMAScript (ES6) which was originally named ES Harmony, before being eventually released with the name ES2015. ES2015 adds significant features and syntactic sugar to allow writing complex applications. Some of the features that ES6 has to offer include</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes, Modules, Arrows</li>
<li>Enhanced object literals</li>
<li>Template strings</li>
<li>Destructuring</li>
<li>Default and rest parameters</li>
<li>Spread operator</li>
<li><code>let</code> and <code>const</code></li>
<li>Iterators <code>for..of</code></li>
<li>Generators</li>
<li><code>map</code> and <code>set</code></li>
<li>Proxies and Symbols</li>
<li>Promises</li>
<li>Math, Number, String, Array, Object APIs and <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">etc</a></li>

<p>Browser support for ES6 is still scarce but everything that ES6 has to offer is still available to developers by transpiling the ES6 code to ES5. With the release of 6th version of ECMAScript, TC39 decided to move to yearly model of releasing updates to ECMAScript so to make sure that the new features are added as soon as they are approved and we don’t have to wait for the full specification to be drafted and approved — thus 6th version of ECMAScript was renamed as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 before the release in June 2015. And the next versions of ECMAScript were decided to published in June of every year.</p>
<h3 id="release-of-es7--ecmascript-2016">Release of ES7 — ECMAScript 2016</h3>
<p>In June 2016, seventh version of ECMAScript was released. As ECMAScript has been moved to an yearly release model, ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016) comparatively did not have much to offer. ES2016 includes just two new features</p>
<ul>
<li>Exponentiation operator <code>**</code></li>
<li><code>Array.prototype.includes</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release-of-es8--ecmascript-2017">Release of ES8 — ECMAScript 2017</h3>
<p>The eighth version of ECMAScript was released in June 2017. The key highlight of ES8 was the addition of async functions. Here is the list of new features in ES8</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Object.values()</code> and <code>Object.entries()</code></li>
<li>String padding i.e. <code>String.prototype.padEnd()</code> and <code>String.prototype.padStart()</code></li>
<li><code>Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors</code></li>
<li>Trailing commas in function parameter lists and calls</li>
<li>Async functions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-esnext-then">What is ESNext then?</h3>
<p>ESNext is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the current version of ECMAScript is at the given time. For example, at the time of this writing <code>ES2017</code> or <code>ES8</code> is the current <code>ESNext</code>.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What does the future hold?</h3>
<p>Since the release of ES6, <a href="https://github.com/tc39" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TC39</a> has quite streamlined their process. TC39 operates through a Github organization now and there are <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">several proposals</a> for new features or syntax to be added to the next versions of ECMAScript. Any one can go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">submit a proposal</a> thus resulting in increasing the participation from the community. Every proposal goes through <a href="https://tc39.github.io/process-document/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">four stages of maturity</a> before it makes it into the specification.</p>

<p>If you are trying to get into tech or are already in tech and have been exploring roles across the industry, you must have come across Development and Operations (DevOps). In fact, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank">DevOps</a> is one of the highest-paying roles in the tech industry.</p>
<p>But <strong>what is DevOps, and how is it different from other roles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DevOps is a software engineering approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to shorten the software development lifecycle</strong> by embracing automation. It is a bridge between the development and operations teams.</p>
<p>While the primary goal of a software engineer is to design and build software solutions, a DevOps engineer has a key role in streamlining the software development and deployment pipeline, automating infrastructure provisioning, and enhancing the deployment process.</p>
<p>This guide provides in-depth knowledge on how to become a DevOps engineer, highlighting the mindset of DevOps engineers and the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/skills" target="_blank">technical skills</a> (including <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/tools" target="_blank">DevOps tools</a>) required to become one. It also guides you on how you can find DevOps engineer jobs.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR:</strong></h2>
<p>DevOps combines development and operations to automate software delivery. To become a DevOps engineer, you should adopt a mindset of <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation" target="_blank">automation</a>, risk awareness, systems thinking, and continuous learning. In addition to the mindset, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Learn a programming language</li>
<li>Step 2: Get comfortable with Linux and terminal</li>
<li>Step 3: Version control and code hosting platforms</li>
<li>Step 4: Networking fundamentals</li>
<li>Step 5: Containerization</li>
<li>Step 6: Cloud services</li>
<li>Step 7: Continuous integration and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive into the essential skills required for a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="skills-required-to-become-a-devops-engineer">Skills required to become a DevOps engineer</h2>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating system</h3>
<p>A DevOps engineer should understand the operating system, especially Linux (distribution or any variant). This is because most of the servers in use are Linux-based, so having a solid foundation in the Linux OS is imperative for infrastructure management and troubleshooting.</p>
<h3 id="solid-programming-fundamentals">Solid programming fundamentals</h3>
<p>As a DevOps engineer, you will use your knowledge of programming languages and scripting languages (bash scripting, shell scripting, etc) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate processes and frequent tasks</li>
<li>Patch a security bug exposing your internal application to outside users</li>
<li>Create <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops/automation-tools" target="_blank">automation tools</a>, monitoring tools, and logging tools</li>
<li>Create monitoring dashboards to visualize workload and resource usage</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, hands-on experience with programming is crucial to excel in your DevOps career.</p>
<h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3>
<p>A basic understanding of version control is one of the essential DevOps skills required for DevOps engineer jobs. In your DevOps career, you will likely work in a team rather than alone. Systems like Git facilitate collaboration in a team while providing a centralized repository for the code.</p>
<h3 id="networking-fundamentals">Networking fundamentals</h3>
<p>Many modern-day applications are distributed systems that rely on networking. For instance, a single application could be composed of a frontend, backend, database, file server, etc., each residing on a separate server. For a seamless user experience, these separate entities should be able to communicate smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="containerization-and-orchestration">Containerization and orchestration</h3>
<p>Containerization (or container technology) and orchestration help solve the issues of software deployment and resource utilization. Knowledge of containerization and orchestration helps reduce deployment time and allows you to scale applications quickly without downtime, resulting in a better user experience.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-deployment">Cloud deployment</h3>
<p>Procuring hardware to deploy the software is not always feasible and beneficial. Furthermore, once you purchase the hardware, you need more time and resources to manage the new hardware. Depending upon the complexity of the application, choosing the cloud instead of on-premise hardware can significantly reduce deployment time and cost.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-iac">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
<p>IaC can be seen as a superior form of automation for a DevOps engineer. IaC tools like Terraform and Amazon Cloud CDK allow the operations team to set up and manage infrastructure by simply changing a configuration file. This makes it easier to manage and scale the application.</p>
<p>So, how do you learn these essential skills? In what sequence do you acquire these skills?</p>
<p>The following section presents a complete DevOps roadmap on how you can learn these skills and become a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-the-devops-roadmap">How to become a DevOps engineer: the DevOps roadmap</h2>
<p>The internet is full of resources for learning DevOps and DevOps tools. Many of these guides lack structure and organization, resulting in a dilemma of where to start.</p>
<p>To help beginners learn DevOps in a structured manner, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a> has a beginner-friendly <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops?r=devops-beginner" target="_blank">DevOps engineer roadmap</a> that will help you land into DevOps engineer positions.</p>
<p>This section presents a concise version of the DevOps engineering roadmap. It is recommended that you implement real-world projects recommended in each stage of the roadmap. In the end, you can publish these DevOps projects to GitHub as an open-source project repository, and the repository will act as your portfolio and increase your exposure in the DevOps community.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-learn-a-programming-language">Step 1: Learn a programming language</h3>
<p>Programming language is essential to a DevOps engineer. I recommend you start with either Python or Go. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a> is a popular language that is easier to learn and used in various projects involving <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">backend</a> development, writing machine learning algorithms, automating everyday tasks, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/learn-a-programming-language-he481.jpeg" alt="Popular programming languages"></p>
<p><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a> is an excellent resource for learning Python and basic programming concepts. It will also come in handy when building automation tools.</p>
<p>To demonstrate your understanding of Python, you can create a web scraper (or other coding projects) that extracts a list of hotels, their address, prices, reviews, and locations from a site like <a href="http://booking.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">booking.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-get-comfortable-with-linux-and-the-terminal">Step 2: Get comfortable with Linux and the terminal</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://gitnux.org/linux-statistics/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gitnux</a>, 92.4% of the world’s top 1 million servers run on Linux, and about 96.3% of the world’s top 1 million websites are powered by Unix-like operating systems, with Linux being one of the most widely used operating systems. This makes Linux a popular tool for all software engineers.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/most-popular-operating-systems-exdwq.jpeg" alt="The most popular operating systems today"></p>
<p>Furthermore, you should make the terminal your best friend. Some programs and packages may not have a GUI counterpart, and even when they exist, using the CLI(Command Line Interface) alternative is faster and easier to automate.</p>
<p>An excellent way to practice Linux for DevOps engineers is to install it on a thumb drive and try to do everyday tasks like changing the directory, creating new files and folders, editing files, searching for files and folders, etc., using Linux commands instead of using the GUI interface.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-version-control-and-code-hosting-platforms">Step 3: Version control and code hosting platforms</h3>
<p>Version control systems like Git make it easier for developers to track changes in their source code by maintaining a history of the changes. Combined with platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket, Git can facilitate developers to work collaboratively with each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/git-and-github-kui4q.jpeg" alt="Git and GitHub"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">This tutorial</a> will help you learn Git basics and how to use Git for collaboration using Bitbucket, a code hosting platform.</p>
<p>For advanced concepts on git branching, <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">refer to this site.</a> Once you go through the tutorial, you can easily switch from Bitbucket to GitHub and GitLab, which are more popular among developers.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-networking-fundamentals">Step 4: Networking fundamentals</h3>
<p>Learning networking fundamentals becomes vital to the DevOps team when working with software components constantly communicating with other services. Knowledge of networks comes in handy when setting up resources in the public cloud. At a minimum, you should clearly understand standard protocols(TCP/IP, UDP), routing, IP addressing, subnetting, and ports.</p>
<p>A DevOps engineer should have a sound knowledge of web servers like Nginx. Nginx allows you to serve your application on the web while handling reverse proxy and load balancing. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Apache</a> is another web server that provides similar features.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/nginx-and-apache-psljm.jpeg" alt="Nginx and Apache"></p>
<p>For your practice, you can create a simple frontend (or clone it from GitHub) and deploy it using Nginx or Apache.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-containerization">Step 5: Containerization</h3>
<p>An application developed by one developer may not work on other machines due to the difference in environment. To eliminate this issue, DevOps engineers use containerization tools like Docker.</p>
<p>Docker allows engineers to create consistent development, testing, and production environments. It also ensures the developed application is portable across different platforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/docker-and-kubernetes-fxplh.jpeg" alt="Docker and Kubernetes"></p>
<p>Applications rely on multiple containers that communicate with each other. To facilitate the orchestration of these containers, you can use container orchestration tools like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. The <a href="https://roadmap.sh/docker" target="_blank">Docker Roadmap</a> provides essential resources to help you master Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate your understanding of containerization tools by creating a simple project with frontend and back deployed as two separate containers. If you have already developed these components in the previous stages of the roadmap, re-use them to save time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, certifications like Docker Certified Associate and Certified Kubernetes Administrator can help you prove your knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-cloud-services">Step 6: Cloud services</h3>
<p>Cloud services like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/aws" target="_blank">AWS</a>, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are some popular cloud providers that allow you to deploy your projects without investing in expensive hardware. Many cloud services across these cloud platforms are analogous.</p>
<p>If you are a beginner, start with AWS. It is the most widely used cloud platform. Once you are comfortable with AWS’s services and key concepts, you can deploy the application created in earlier stages to the AWS.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could demonstrate your understanding by taking the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/?trk=dc557659-52ab-4a28-b2b8-0b1fb90235db&#x26;sc_channel=ps&#x26;ef_id=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pRXCRcI-uDNNigl81tPxsbbyV9RqT6MsdSM_x5EzoFnfxcr6N22rvBoCS7IQAvD_BwE:G:s&#x26;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!465713397254!e!!g!!aws%20certification!11138243015!111694711080&#x26;gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pRXCRcI-uDNNigl81tPxsbbyV9RqT6MsdSM_x5EzoFnfxcr6N22rvBoCS7IQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">certification exam from AWS</a>. Becoming an AWS certified DevOps engineer helps you gain credibility for your DevOps skills.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/top-cloud-providers-76zj5.jpeg" alt="Top cloud providers"></p>
<p>Once comfortable launching your infrastructure using the GUI, you should learn about Infrastructure as Code(IaC). I recommend using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Terraform</a> for IaC as it is cloud-agnostic and popular among software developers and operations teams. Terraform allows you to set up and make changes to infrastructure resources by editing a configuration file, resulting in infrastructure automation.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-continuous-integration-and-delivery">Step 7: Continuous integration and delivery</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyKZTKQS_EQ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery</a> (or Continuous Deployment) (CI/CD) is a set of practices aimed at automating and streamlining software changes from development to production.</p>
<p>Today, in practice, when you commit and push your changes to the remote repository (say GitHub), the tests kick-off; if the tests pass successfully, your changes are merged and then deployed to the staging and production server.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/ci-cd-hndye.jpeg" alt="CI/CD"></p>
<p>CI/CD is a combination of three skills: programming, writing configuration files, and Git. As such, you don’t need to learn new skills to implement CI/CD. However, some organizations use tools like CircleCI and Jenkins to simplify the process.</p>
<p>You can practice CI/CD using GitHub actions. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub provides a set of tutorials</a> for the same. You can follow along those tutorials to get a good grasp of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.</p>
<p>Finally, you can implement CICD in one of your projects created while learning previous skills in this roadmap.</p>
<p>Next, let’s discuss the mindset needed to become a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="devops-engineers-mindset">DevOps engineer’s mindset</h2>
<p>To become a successful DevOps engineer and successfully embrace the DevOps culture, you must orient your thoughts around the following:</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Software products or systems are prone to various errors, including human errors. Stress during work and the race against deadlines can increase the frequency of these errors. Automating processes helps reduce human error and eliminate boring tasks.</p>
<h3 id="risk-awareness">Risk awareness</h3>
<p>DevOps engineers must understand the risks entangled with changes to a software system and deployment infrastructures. The risk should be minimized by utilizing automated testing, monitoring, and incremental changes.</p>
<h3 id="systems-thinking">Systems thinking</h3>
<p>DevOps professionals or any member of the operations teams must understand how different components within a system communicate and interact with each other to deliver the desired solution. A graphical representation of the system can come in handy when fixing issues or knowledge transfer within the DevOps teams.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-learning">Continuous learning</h3>
<p>A continuous learning and continuous improvement mindset is essential across all roles in software engineering, but its importance is amplified for a DevOps engineer. A DevOps engineer must continually learn about new technologies, tools, DevOps principles, and DevOps practices and implement the ones best suited to the project.</p>
<p>You may not have the DevOps mindset, but that is okay. You can build this mindset as you learn and grow into the role. Let us look at some technical skills required to become a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-become-a-devops-engineer">Who can become a DevOps engineer?</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-learn-web-development-fundamentals">Step 1: Learn web development fundamentals</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/learn-web-fundementals-bg7c8.jpeg" alt="Web development fundamentals"></p>
<p>The first step toward becoming a front-end developer is to learn the fundamentals. These are the foundations for everything you create on the web.</p>
<p>It involves learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</strong>: For structuring the content on a webpage. HTML is the blueprint or skeletal structure of a website. It defines the different elements of websites, like headings, paragraphs, and images.</li>
<li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> For styling the content on a webpage. It is a styling language that controls the layout and appearance of HTML-based web pages. With CSS, you can add colors, fonts, and more to your web pages.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> adds interactivity and functionality to web pages. It is a programming language that makes HTML and CSS static websites functional. Thanks to JavaScript, web pages can respond to user actions. For example, you can achieve your desired outcome when you click a button or submit a form on a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building beautiful websites and applications begins with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It gives you many job options in web development and lets you create your own website!</p>
<h3 id="step-2-practice-building-projects">Step 2: Practice building projects</h3>
<p>Coding is like playing video games: you have to put in a lot of practice to become proficient. So, don’t just watch or read tutorials about coding concepts daily–apply them! It will improve your programming skills. If all you do is learn without practicing, you will be an expert in theory but an amateur in practice.</p>
<p>Write code regularly and work on building projects, no matter how small. Follow a learning, practicing, and repetition cycle to enhance your skills. As you work on small projects, you’ll gain experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Some ways to practice building projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal projects</strong>: Build projects that address a problem or individual needs. These include tribute pages, calculators, or to-do list applications.</li>
<li>Join a technical team or find a coding partner to work on a project together.</li>
<li><strong>Project work</strong>: Work on a client project or contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. It will allow you to learn from others, contribute to existing code, and connect with new people.</li>
<li><strong>Code challenges</strong>: Participate in code challenges on platforms like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>. These sites provide various exercises for practicing <a href="https://cesscode.hashnode.dev/resources-to-help-you-practice-web-development" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">front-end and building websites</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you practice coding consistently, you will face a lot of issues. The more problems you solve, the better you become.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-learn-the-version-control-systems-and-the-command-line">Step 3: Learn the version control systems and the command line.</h3>
<p>As a front-end developer, learning version control systems <strong>(VCS)</strong> and the command line is vital. They make it easier for you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track and manage source code modifications.</li>
<li>Work with others on the same project.</li>
<li>Streamline your workflow and automate tasks.</li>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nBJDuVO.png" alt="Private Network"></p>
<p>Application server has both a public and private IP address. It is accessible from the internet. Database server has only a private IP address and is accessible only from the application server.</p>
<p>It is a common practice to have this setup due to security reasons. This is done to prevent unauthorized access to the database server.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-jump-server">What is a Jump Server?</h2>
<p>A jump server is a server that is used to access other servers. It is also known as a bastion host. It is a server that is accessible from the internet and is used to access other servers that are not accessible from the internet.</p>
<p>In the above example, the application server is called the jump server.</p>
<p>For example, you might have this infrastructure on AWS, where you have a custom VPC with two subnets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Subnet:</strong> Outside world can access</li>
<li><strong>Private Subnet:</strong> Only accessible from within the VPC</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say that the application server is in the public subnet and the database server is in the private subnet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about AWS VPC, check out this <a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/up-and-running-with-aws-vpc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">detailed guide about AWS VPC</a>, Subnets and everything else you need to know about AWS VPC.

</blockquote>
<p>We can easily SSH into the application server from the internet i.e.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@3.112.5.67</span></span></code></pre>
<p>But the database server doesn’t have a public IP address. So, we can’t SSH into it from the internet. For example, following won’t work</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"># Won't work because the IP address is private</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@192.168.1.0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now if we have to SSH into the database server, we have to first SSH into the application server and then SSH into the database server from there. Because the application server, being in the same VPC, can access the database server.</p>
<h2 id="lets-try-it-out">Let’s try it Out</h2>
<p>Let’s first SSH into the application server:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@3.112.5.67</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once we are inside the application server, let’s try to SSH into the database server:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@192.168.1.0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We have an error:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Warning: Identity file /home/ubuntu/.ssh/mykey.pem not accessible: No such file or directory.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ubuntu@192.168.1.0: Permission denied (publickey).</span></span></code></pre>
<p>What happened? The reason is that the private key is not present on the application server i.e. <code>~/.ssh/mykey.pem</code>. Now, there are two ways to solve this problem.</p>
<h3 id="solution-1---copy-the-private-key-to-server">Solution 1 - Copy the Private Key to Server</h3>
<p>We can copy the private key from our local machine to the application server and use it there to access the database server. You can do that by running the following command on your local machine:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">scp</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> path/to/key.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> examplefile</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> yourusername@yourserver:/home/yourusername/</span></span></code></pre>
<p>i.e. in our case it will be</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">scp</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@3.112.5.67:/home/ubuntu/</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">#   --------^---------- -------^-------- ----^--- ----^----- ----^--------</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">#      key file path      file to copy     user      host    path to copy</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can SSH into the application server and use the private key copied at <code>/home/ubuntu/mykey.pem</code> to access the database server.</p>
<p>The issue with this solution is that if our application server is compromised, the attacker will have access to our private key and can access the database server.</p>
<h3 id="solution-2---use-ssh-agent-forwarding">Solution 2 - Use SSH Agent Forwarding</h3>
<p>The second solution is to use SSH agent forwarding. SSH agent forwarding is a technique that allows you to access a server that is not accessible from the internet. Follow these steps to set up the SSH agent forwarding:</p>
<p>Add the private key (.pem file) that we use to connect to the application server to our local SSH agen:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh-add</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now if you run <code>ssh-add -l</code> you will see the key added to the agent:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>2048 SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx path/to/key.pem (RSA)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now let’s SSH into the application server using the following command</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -A</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ~/.ssh/mykey.pem</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@3.112.5.67</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">#  ^^^ -A flag is used to enable agent forwarding</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have SSHed into the application server, you can SSH into the database server simply by using the following command:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ssh</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ec2-user@192.168.1.0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Voila! You have successfully SSHed into the database server from the application server.</p>

<p>Now, we can even have a single command to SSH into the database server without first having to SSH int the application server. We can do that by using the <code>-J</code> flag which is used to specify the jump server.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we learned about the jump server and how to use SSH agent forwarding to access a server that is not accessible from the internet. We also learned how to simplify the SSH command by adding host entries to the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file.</p>`,sr={title:"Jump Servers: What, Why and How",description:"Learn what is a Jump Server and how to set it up for SSH access.",authorId:"kamran",seo:{title:"Jump Servers: What, Why and How - roadmap.sh",description:"Learn what is a Jump Server and how to set it up for SSH access."},isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2023-03-20T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","visual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},tr="/workspace/src/data/guides/how-to-setup-a-jump-server.md",or=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=sr;return e.file=tr,e.url=or,l`${p()}${r(ar())}`});const ir=()=>`<p>Our last guide was about the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/basics-of-authentication" target="_blank">basics of authentication</a>, where we discussed authentication, authorization, types of authentication, authentication factors, authentication strategies, and so on.</p>
<p>In this guide today, we will be learning about basic authentication, and we will see how we can implement Basic Authentication in Node.js. We have a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/basic-authentication" target="_blank">visual guide on the basic authentication</a> and an illustrative video, watch the video below or continue reading:</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mwccHwUn7Gc" title="HTTP Basic Authentication"></iframe>
<h2 id="what-is-basic-authentication">What is Basic Authentication?</h2>
<p>Given the name “Basic Authentication”, you should not confuse Basic Authentication with the standard username and password authentication. Basic authentication is a part of the HTTP specification, and the details can be <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">found in the RFC7617</a>.</p>
<p>Because it is a part of the HTTP specifications, all the browsers have native support for “HTTP Basic Authentication”. Given below is the screenshot from the implementation in Google Chrome.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/basic-authentication/chrome-basic-auth.png" alt="Chrome Basic Authentication"></p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it Work?</h2>
<p>Now that we know what basic authentication is, the question is, how does it work? The answer is: it is controlled by the response of the server.</p>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>When the browser first requests the server, the server tries to check the availability of the <code>Authorization</code> header in the request. Because it is the first request, no <code>Authorization</code> header is found in the request. So the server responds with the <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response code and also sends the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header with the value set to <code>Basic</code>, which tells the browser that it needs to trigger the basic authentication flow.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>401 Unauthorized</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm='user_pages'</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you notice the response, we have an additional parameter called <code>realm</code>, which is just a value assigned to a group of pages that share the same credentials.</p>
<p>The browser might use Realm to cache the credential. In the future, when there is an authentication failure browser will check if it has the credentials in the cache for the given realm of the domain, and it may use the same credentials.</p>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p>Upon receiving the response from the server, the browser will notice the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header and will show the authentication popup.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/basic-authentication/chrome-basic-auth.png" alt="Chrome Basic Authentication"></p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p>After the user submits the credentials through this authentication popup, the browser will automatically encode the credentials using the <code>base64</code> encoding and send them in the <code>Authorization</code> header of the same request.</p>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the request, the server will decode and verify the credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server will send the response to the client.</p>
<p>So that is how Basic Authentication works.</p>
<h2 id="basic-authentication-in-nodejs">Basic Authentication in Node.js</h2>
<p>I have prepared the sample project in Node.js, which can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/node-basic-auth-example" target="_blank">kamranahmedse/node-basic-auth-example</a>.

Loading the resources from some cache is much faster than fetching the same from the originating server. It reduces latency, speeds up the loading of resources, decreases the load on the server, cuts down the bandwidth costs etc.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>What is a web cache? It is something that sits somewhere between the client and the server, continuously looking at the requests and their responses, looking for any responses that can be cached. So that there is less time consumed when the same request is made again.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mJYVvTh.png" alt="Web Cache"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this image is just to give you an idea. Depending upon the type of cache, the place where it is implemented could vary. More on this later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we get into further details, let me give you an overview of the terms that will be used, further in the article</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client</strong> could be your browser or any application requesting the server for some resource</li>
<li><strong>Origin Server</strong>, the source of truth, houses all the content required by the client and is responsible for fulfilling the client’s requests.</li>
<li><strong>Stale Content</strong> is cached but expired content</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Content</strong> is the content available in the cache that hasn’t expired yet</li>
<li><strong>Cache Validation</strong> is the process of contacting the server to check the validity of the cached content and get it updated for when it is going to expire</li>
<li><strong>Cache Invalidation</strong> is the process of removing any stale content available in the cache</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9MjlzvW.png" alt="Web Cache"></p>
<h3 id="caching-locations">Caching Locations</h3>
<p>Web cache can be shared or private depending upon the location where it exists. Here is the list of different caching locations</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#browser-cache">Browser Cache</a></li>
<li><a href="#proxy-cache">Proxy Cache</a></li>
<li><a href="#reverse-proxy-cache">Reverse Proxy Cache</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="browser-cache">Browser Cache</h4>
<p>You might have noticed that when you click the back button in your browser it takes less time to load the page than the time that it took during the first load; this is the browser cache in play. Browser cache is the most common location for caching and browsers usually reserve some space for it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mJYVvTh.png" alt="Web Cache"></p>
<p>A browser cache is limited to just one user and unlike other caches, it can store the “private” responses. More on it later.</p>
<h4 id="proxy-cache">Proxy Cache</h4>
<p>Unlike browser cache which serves a single user, proxy caches may serve hundreds of different users accessing the same content. They are usually implemented on a broader level by ISPs or any other independent entities for example.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3mj6e1O.png" alt="Proxy Cache"></p>
<h4 id="reverse-proxy-cache">Reverse Proxy Cache</h4>
<p>A Reverse proxy cache or surrogate cache is implemented close to the origin servers in order to reduce the load on the server. Unlike proxy caches which are implemented by ISPs etc to reduce the bandwidth usage in a network, surrogates or reverse proxy caches are implemented near the origin servers by the server administrators to reduce the load on the server.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eg4Cru3.png" alt="Reverse Proxy Cache"></p>
<p>Although you can control the reverse proxy caches (since it is implemented by you on your server) you can not avoid or control browser and proxy caches. And if your website is not configured to use these caches properly, it will still be cached using whatever defaults are set on these caches.</p>
<h3 id="caching-headers">Caching Headers</h3>
<p>So, how do we control the web cache? Whenever the server emits some response, it is accompanied by some HTTP headers to guide the caches on whether and how to cache this response. The content provider is the one that has to make sure to return proper HTTP headers to force the caches on how to cache the content.</p>

<h4 id="expires">Expires</h4>
<p>Before HTTP/1.1 and the introduction of <code>Cache-Control</code>, there was an <code>Expires</code> header which is simply a timestamp telling the caches how long should some content be considered fresh. A possible value to this header is the absolute expiry date; where a date has to be in GMT. Below is the sample header</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Expires: Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:22:00 GMT</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It should be noted that the date cannot be more than a year and if the date format is wrong, the content will be considered stale. Also, the clock on the cache has to be in sync with the clock on the server, otherwise, the desired results might not be achieved.</p>
<p>Although the <code>Expires</code> header is still valid and is supported widely by the caches, preference should be given to HTTP/1.1 successor of it i.e. <code>Cache-Control</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pragma">Pragma</h4>
<p>Another one from the old, pre HTTP/1.1 days, is <code>Pragma</code>. Everything that it could do is now possible using the cache-control header given below. However, one thing I would like to point out about it is, that you might see <code>Pragma: no-cache</code> being used here and there in hopes of stopping the response from being cached. It might not necessarily work; as HTTP specification discusses it in the request headers and there is no mention of it in the response headers. Rather <code>Cache-Control</code> header should be used to control the caching.</p>
<h4 id="cache-control">Cache-Control</h4>
<p>Cache-Control specifies how long and in what manner should the content be cached. This family of headers was introduced in HTTP/1.1 to overcome the limitations of the <code>Expires</code> header.</p>
<p>Value for the <code>Cache-Control</code> header is composite i.e. it can have multiple directive/values. Let’s look at the possible values that this header may contain.</p>
<h5 id="private">private</h5>
<p>Setting the cache to <code>private</code> means that the content will not be cached in any of the proxies and it will only be cached by the client (i.e. browser)</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: private</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Having said that, don’t let it fool you into thinking that setting this header will make your data any secure; you still have to use SSL for that purpose.</p>
<h5 id="public">public</h5>
<p>If set to <code>public</code>, apart from being cached by the client, it can also be cached by the proxies; serving many other users</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: public</span></span></code></pre>
<h5 id="no-store">no-store</h5>
<p><strong><code>no-store</code></strong> specifies that the content is not to be cached by any of the caches</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: no-store</span></span></code></pre>
<h5 id="no-cache">no-cache</h5>
<p><strong><code>no-cache</code></strong> indicates that the cache can be maintained but the cached content is to be re-validated (using <code>ETag</code> for example) from the server before being served. That is, there is still a request to server but for validation and not to download the cached content.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: max-age=3600, no-cache, public</span></span></code></pre>
<h5 id="max-age-seconds">max-age: seconds</h5>
<p><strong><code>max-age</code></strong> specifies the number of seconds for which the content will be cached. For example, if the <code>cache-control</code> looks like below:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public</span></span></code></pre>
<p>it would mean that the content is publicly cacheable and will be considered stale after 60 minutes</p>
<h5 id="s-maxage-seconds">s-maxage: seconds</h5>
<p><strong><code>s-maxage</code></strong> here <code>s-</code> prefix stands for shared. This directive specifically targets the shared caches. Like <code>max-age</code> it also gets the number of seconds for which something is to be cached. If present, it will override <code>max-age</code> and <code>expires</code> headers for shared caching.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: s-maxage=3600, public</span></span></code></pre>
<h5 id="must-revalidate">must-revalidate</h5>
<p><strong><code>must-revalidate</code></strong> it might happen sometimes that if you have network problems and the content cannot be retrieved from the server, the browser may serve stale content without validation. <code>must-revalidate</code> avoids that. If this directive is present, it means that stale content cannot be served in any case and the data must be re-validated from the server before serving.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public, must-revalidate</span></span></code></pre>
<h5 id="proxy-revalidate">proxy-revalidate</h5>
<p><strong><code>proxy-revalidate</code></strong> is similar to <code>must-revalidate</code> but it specifies the same for shared or proxy caches. In other words <code>proxy-revalidate</code> is to <code>must-revalidate</code> as <code>s-maxage</code> is to <code>max-age</code>. But why did they not call it <code>s-revalidate</code>?. I have no idea why, if you have any clue please leave a comment below.</p>
<h5 id="mixing-values">Mixing Values</h5>
<p>You can combine these directives in different ways to achieve different caching behaviors, however <code>no-cache/no-store</code> and <code>public/private</code> are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>If you specify both <code>no-store</code> and <code>no-cache</code>, <code>no-store</code> will be given precedence over <code>no-cache</code>.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; If specified both Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache ; Below will be considered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Cache-Control: no-store</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For <code>private/public</code>, for any unauthenticated requests cache is considered <code>public</code> and for any authenticated ones cache is considered <code>private</code>.</p>
<h3 id="validators">Validators</h3>
<p>Up until now we only discussed how the content is cached and how long the cached content is to be considered fresh but we did not discuss how the client does the validation from the server. Below we discuss the headers used for this purpose.</p>
<h4 id="etag">ETag</h4>
<p>Etag or “entity tag” was introduced in HTTP/1.1 specs. Etag is just a unique identifier that the server attaches with some resource. This ETag is later on used by the client to make conditional HTTP requests stating <code>"give me this resource if ETag is not same as the ETag that I have"</code> and the content is downloaded only if the etags do not match.</p>
<p>Method by which ETag is generated is not specified in the HTTP docs and usually some collision-resistant hash function is used to assign etags to each version of a resource. There could be two types of etags i.e. strong and weak</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">ETag: "j82j8232ha7sdh0q2882" - Strong Etag ETag: W/"j82j8232ha7sdh0q2882" - Weak</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Etag (prefixed with \`W/\`)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>A strong validating ETag means that two resources are <strong>exactly</strong> same and there is no difference between them at all. While a weak ETag means that two resources although not strictly the same but could be considered the same. Weak etags might be useful for dynamic content, for example.</p>
<p>Now you know what etags are but how does the browser make this request? by making a request to server while sending the available Etag in <code>If-None-Match</code> header.</p>
<p>Consider the scenario, you opened a web page which loaded a logo image with caching period of 60 seconds and ETag of <code>abc123xyz</code>. After about 30 minutes you reload the page, browser will notice that the logo which was fresh for 60 seconds is now stale; it will trigger a request to server, sending the ETag of the stale logo image in <code>if-none-match</code> header</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">If-None-Match: "abc123xyz"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Server will then compare this ETag with the ETag of the current version of resource. If both etags are matched, server will send back the response of <code>304 Not Modified</code> which will tell the client that the copy that it has is still good and it will be considered fresh for another 60 seconds. If both the etags do not match i.e. the logo has likely changed and client will be sent the new logo which it will use to replace the stale logo that it has.</p>
<h4 id="last-modified">Last-Modified</h4>
<p>Server might include the <code>Last-Modified</code> header indicating the date and time at which some content was last modified on.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Mar 2017 12:30:26 GMT</span></span></code></pre>
<p>When the content gets stale, client will make a conditional request including the last modified date that it has inside the header called <code>If-Modified-Since</code> to server to get the updated <code>Last-Modified</code> date; if it matches the date that the client has, <code>Last-Modified</code> date for the content is updated to be considered fresh for another <code>n</code> seconds. If the received <code>Last-Modified</code> date does not match the one that the client has, content is reloaded from the server and replaced with the content that client has.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">If-Modified-Since: Wed, 15 Mar 2017 12:30:26 GMT</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You might be questioning now, what if the cached content has both the <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>ETag</code> assigned to it? Well, in that case both are to be used i.e. there will not be any re-downloading of the resource if and only if <code>ETag</code> matches the newly retrieved one and so does the <code>Last-Modified</code> date. If either the <code>ETag</code> does not match or the <code>Last-Modified</code> is greater than the one from the server, content has to be downloaded again.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-start">Where do I start?</h3>
<p>Now that we have got <em>everything</em> covered, let us put everything in perspective and see how you can use this information.</p>
<h4 id="utilizing-server">Utilizing Server</h4>
<p>Before we get into the possible caching strategies , let me add the fact that most of the servers including Apache and Nginx allow you to implement your caching policy through the server so that you don’t have to juggle with headers in your code.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, if you are using Apache and you have your static content placed at <code>/static</code>, you can put below <code>.htaccess</code> file in the directory to make all the content in it be cached for an year using below</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2"># Cache everything for an year Header set Cache-Control "max-age=31536000,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">public"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You can further use <code>filesMatch</code> directive to add conditionals and use different caching strategy for different kinds of files e.g.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2"># Cache any images for one year</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">&#x3C;</span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">filesMatch</span><span> </span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">".(png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$"</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">    Header set Cache-Control "max-age=31536000, public"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">&#x3C;/</span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">filesMatch</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">></span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2"># Cache any CSS and JS files for a month</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">&#x3C;</span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">filesMatch</span><span> </span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">".(css|js)$"</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">    Header set Cache-Control "max-age=2628000, public"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">&#x3C;/</span><span style="color:#FF5555;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">filesMatch</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Or if you don’t want to use the <code>.htaccess</code> file you can modify Apache’s configuration file <code>http.conf</code>. Same goes for Nginx, you can add the caching information in the location or server block.</p>
<h4 id="caching-recommendations">Caching Recommendations</h4>
<p>There is no golden rule or set standards about how your caching policy should look like, each of the application is different and you have to look and find what suits your application the best. However, just to give you a rough idea</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have aggressive caching (e.g. cache for an year) on any static content and use fingerprinted filenames (e.g. <code>style.ju2i90.css</code>) so that the cache is automatically rejected whenever the files are updated.
Also it should be noted that you should not cross the upper limit of one year as it <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">might not be honored</a></li>
<li>Look and decide do you even need caching for any dynamic content, if yes how long it should be. For example, in case of some RSS feed of a blog there could be the caching of a few hours but there couldn’t be any caching for inventory items in an ERP.</li>
<li>Always add the validators (preferably ETags) in your response.</li>
<li>Pay attention while choosing the visibility (private or public) of the cached content. Make sure that you do not accidentally cache any user-specific or sensitive content in any public proxies. When in doubt, do not use cache at all.</li>
<li>Separate the content that changes often from the content that doesn’t change that often (e.g. in javascript bundles) so that when it is updated it doesn’t need to make the whole cached content stale.</li>
<li>Test and monitor the caching headers being served by your site. You can use the browser console or <code>curl -I http://some-url.com</code> for that purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that about wraps it up.

GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/trending" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">trending page</a> is flooded with repositories that are using LLMs in one way or another. But what are LLMs? How do they work? What are the use cases? In this high level, introductory guide, we will try to answer these questions.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-llms">What are LLMs?</h2>
<p>LLM stands for “Large Language Model.” These are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as answering questions, carrying out conversations, summarizing text, translating languages, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/kamrify/status/1658271217189634049" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://roadmap.sh/guides/llms.png" alt="LLMS Visualized"></a></p>
<p>OpenAI has been a major contributor to this space in the past few years with their models and research. However, there are other players in the market as well e.g. Meta with their <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-66b" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OPT</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-iml-30b" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OPT-IML</a> and <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LLaMA</a> models, Google released <a href="https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FLAN-T5</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BERT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stability-AI/stableLM/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">StableLM</a> by Stability AI, <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Alpaca</a> at Stanford and there are many <a href="https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">other opensource models as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="training-an-llm-model">Training an LLM Model</h2>
<p>On a high level, training an LLM model involves three steps i.e. data collection, training and evaluation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The first step is to collect the data that will be used to train the model. The data can be collected from various sources, such as Wikipedia, news articles, books, websites, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training</strong>: The data then goes through a training pipeline where it is cleaned and preprocessed before being fed into the model for training. The training process usually takes a long time and requires a lot of computational power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The final step is to evaluate the performance of the model to see how well it performs on various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, translation, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output from the training Pipeline is an LLM model which is simply the parameters or weights which capture the knowledge learned during the training process. These parameters or weights are typically serialized and stored in a file, which can then be loaded into any application that requires language processing capabilities e.g. text generation, question answering, language processing etc.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-llms">Types of LLMs</h2>
<p>On a high level, LLMs can be categorized into two types i.e. Base LLMs and Instruction tuned LLMs.</p>
<h3 id="base-llms">Base LLMs</h3>
<p>Base LLMs are the LLMs which are designed to predict the next word based on the training data. They are not designed to answer questions, carry out conversations or help solve problems. For example, if you give a base LLM the sentence “In this book about LLMs, we will discuss”, it might complete this sentence and give you “In this book about LLMs, we will discuss <strong>what LLMs are, how they work, and how you can leverage them in your applications.</strong>.” Or if you give it “What are some famous social networks?”, instead of answering it might give back “Why do people use social networks?” or “What are some of the benefits of social networks?”. As you can see, it is giving us relevant text but it is not answering the question. This is where the Instruction tuned LLMs come in to the picture.</p>
<h3 id="instruction-tuned-llms">Instruction tuned LLMs</h3>
<p>Instruction Tuned LLMs, instead of trying to autocomplete your text, try to follow the given instructions using the data that they have been trained on. For example, if you input the sentence “What are LLMs?” it will use the data that it is trained on and try to answer the question. Similarly, if you input “What are some famous social networks?” it will try to answer the question instead of giving you a random answer.</p>
<p>Instruction Tuned LLMs are built on top of Base LLMs:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Instruction Tuned LLMs = Base LLMs + Further Tuning + RLHF</span></span></code></pre>
<p>To build an Instruction Tuned LLM, a Base LLM is taken and is further trained using a large dataset covering sample “Instructions” and how the model should perform as a result of those instructions. The model is then fine-tuned using a technique called “Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback” (RLHF) which allows the model to learn from human feedback and improve its performance over time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>LLMs are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of language-related tasks. They are being used in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, education, etc., to automate processes and improve efficiency. LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and make our lives easier.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/front-end-java-development-m9zv6.JPG" alt="front end java development"></p>
<h3 id="html-and-css">HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the building block for all web pages. It dictates users’ content and structure when interacting with a website or application, including text, images, videos, and more.</p>
<p>Whereas HTML provides the structure of web pages, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) enhance their appearance and layout. CSS determines how the content on a web page is styled and presented, including aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and more. Additionally, CSS helps you create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/html-and-css-kktts.JPG" alt="HTML and CSS"></p>
<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality and interactivity of web pages. Whereas HTML and CSS are responsible for creating the structure and design of web pages, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> adds dynamic elements such as content updates, animations, 2D/3D graphics, and other interactive features. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, introducing powerful frameworks such as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/react" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/vue" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a>, among others. These frameworks empower you to build software ranging from small applications to large-scale enterprise systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://jbstechinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/JavaScript-Symbol.png" alt="JavaScript"></p>
<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>
<p>Typescript is an extension of JavaScript with static typing and other advanced features. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/typescript" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> code transpiles to JavaScript and can run seamlessly wherever JavaScript runs, making it a highly versatile programming language for front-end development. The knowledge enhances your productivity by allowing you to build robust applications, detect errors, and catch issues as they happen.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQHLiHtRbPUoAA/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1696134741709?e=2147483647&#x26;v=beta&#x26;t=CajO9eTDp6iKznPn753F6ZUyTgaPf6DOzihN1AMMJew" alt="TypeScript"></p>
<h3 id="accessibility-standards-and-compatibility">Accessibility standards and compatibility</h3>

<p>Java and JavaScript are among the most popular programming languages in web development. They were both created in 1995: Sun Microsystems released Java in May, and Netscape released JavaScript in September. Despite coming out in the same year with similar names, Java and Javascript are two distinct programming languages with different designs, purposes, and use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/java" target="_blank">Java</a> is an object-oriented programming language used to create complex web applications ranging from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise software like banking software. Java is platform-independent—it can work on any device with a Java Virtual Machine <strong>(JVM)</strong> installed. This makes it suitable for backend development and high-performance software.</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> is a lightweight scripting language for creating dynamic web interactions. It runs in web browsers and enables developers to build interactive web pages. Examples of these interactions include forms, animations, and more. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS in frontend web development. However, full stack developers now use JavaScript through Node.js to create backend applications.</p>
<p>Knowing when to use each language will help you choose the right one for your projects and career goals. I will explain the key differences between Java and JavaScript in this guide. I will also cover their syntax, runtime environments, key features, advantages, and disadvantages.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>
Java and JavaScript may share similar names, but they serve distinct purposes. Thanks to its platform independence and high performance, Java is a robust, object-oriented language ideal for building large-scale applications like enterprise software and Android apps. Conversely, JavaScript is a lightweight, flexible scripting language used for creating dynamic, interactive web pages and full stack applications with tools like Node.js. Each language excels in different use cases—choose Java for backend-heavy, scalable systems and JavaScript for web interactivity and rapid development.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-differences-between-java-and-javascript">The key differences between Java and JavaScript</h2>
<p>Note that the purpose of this guide is not to compare or select a winner between Java and JavaScript. Instead, it aims to help you know the strengths of each programming language and which to use.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the differences between both programming languages:</p>








































<table><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Java</th><th>JavaScript</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Syntax</td><td>Statically typed, verbose</td><td>Dynamically typed, concise</td></tr><tr><td>Runtime environment</td><td>JVM</td><td>Web Browser</td></tr><tr><td>Execution environment</td><td>Server-side programming</td><td>Client-side, server-side (Node.js)</td></tr><tr><td>Primary use case</td><td>Server-side application development, Android apps</td><td>Client-side development</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>High-performance, optimized</td><td>Often slower, more flexible</td></tr><tr><td>Compilation</td><td>Compiled into bytecode (compiled language)</td><td>Interpreted in web browsers or Node.js (interpreted language)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="java-vs-javascript-syntax">Java vs. JavaScript: Syntax</h3>
<p>Java and JavaScript have different syntaxes. Java is a statically typed language with a more verbose syntax. It has a more rigid syntax, so developers must declare exactly the variable type they use. Doing this leads to fewer errors but requires more lines of code to complete a task. The following are syntax code snippets showing this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="java"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD;font-style:italic">int</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> number </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 5</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD;font-style:italic">String</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> message </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> "</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">Sign up on roadmap</span><span style="color:#E9F284">"</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In contrast, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language with a more concise syntax. It is more flexible, so you do not have to declare what type of variable you are using. Doing this makes coding faster but leads to runtime errors if you are not careful. Example of a JavaScript code syntax:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">let</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> number </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 5</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">number </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> '</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">Sign up on roadmap</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; </span><span style="color:#6272A4">// The number variable can be casually reassigned to a string</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Usually saved in a .js file extension, this code will show <strong>“Sign up on roadmap”</strong> on the console.</p>
<h3 id="java-vs-javascript-execution-and-runtime">Java vs. JavaScript: Execution and runtime</h3>
<p>Java is often used for server-side programming. It is a compiled language that requires a Java Virtual Machine <strong>(JVM)</strong> to run Java code. Before running your code, it’s compiled into bytecode, a platform-independent format. The JVM then executes the bytecode to ensure that Java programs run on any system with JVM installed. It makes Java a good choice for large-scale applications that run on any operating system. These operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/java-vs-javascript-execution-and-runtime-csnnz.png" alt=""></p>
<p>JavaScript, however, is often used for client-side web development. It is an interpreted language that runs in the web browser <strong>(Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.)</strong> or runtime environment like Node.js. There is no separate compilation step like in Java programming language. Instead, developers can see the results of their code changes as soon as they make them. Doing this makes JavaScript a good choice for building interactive websites.</p>
<h3 id="java-vs-javascript-use-case-suitability">Java vs. JavaScript: Use case suitability</h3>
<p>Java is an <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">object-oriented programming language</a> used to build various applications. It’s quick, dependable, and versatile, so it’s great for creating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native apps.</li>
<li>Data analysis tools.</li>
<li>Desktop apps.</li>
<li>Backend apps.</li>
<li>Android apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/java-vs-javascript-use-case-suitability-ev9gw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create a web application user interface. Its dynamic nature makes it work well with web browsers, which is good for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game development.</li>
<li>Interactive web page experiences.</li>
<li>Cross-platform app development (with React Native framework).</li>
<li>Frontend and full stack development (Node.js).</li>
</ul>
<p>Java and JavaScript are important for a lot of leading tech companies**.** Tech companies like ****Amazon, Netflix, and Uber use Java for their backend systems, while Google, Facebook, and Netflix use JavaScript for their frontend services.</p>
<h3 id="performance-impacts">Performance impacts</h3>
<p>Java’s compiled nature makes it better for building large-scale applications. However, its setup and execution can take a bit more time. So, it’s not as perfect as JavaScript for tasks that need quick feedback, like chat apps.</p>
<p>JavaScript focuses on being fast and flexible for client-side interactions. Its event-driven nature makes carrying out tasks like document object model (DOM) manipulation easy. But, it may struggle with CPU-intensive tasks like data compression and decompression.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-javascript-and-java">Key features of JavaScript and Java</h2>
<p>Java and JavaScript each have unique features that are perfect for specific tasks. The table below summarizes the key features of both programming languages:</p>



































<table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>Java</th><th>JavaScript</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concurrency</td><td>Multi-threading support</td><td>Event-driven, single-threaded with asynchronous built-in support</td></tr><tr><td>Inheritance model</td><td>Class-based inheritance</td><td>Prototype-based inheritance</td></tr><tr><td>Memory management</td><td>Automatic garbage collection</td><td>Automatic garbage collection (modern engines)</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-platform</td><td>JVM</td><td>Browsers and on servers (Node.js)</td></tr><tr><td>Paradigm</td><td>Primarily object-oriented</td><td>Multi-paradigm</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="multi-threading-vs-asynchronous-calls">Multi-threading vs. Asynchronous calls</h3>
<p>Java is an object-based programming language with built-in support for multi-threading. It lets you write applications that run multiple threads <strong>(many tasks)</strong> at the same time. Multi-threading is especially useful for server-side applications, such as web application servers. It lets them juggle many requests at once, making them run quicker and more responsive.</p>
<p>JavaScript, unlike Java, is single-threaded. So, it can only work on one task at a time. However, It has built-in support for asynchronous programming <strong>(callbacks, promises, and async/await)</strong>. This way, developers can work on many background tasks without blocking the main task. It helps create responsive and non-blocking web applications, e.g., chat applications.</p>
<p>The event-driven nature of the JavaScript language is another key feature. It enables websites to react to user actions, e.g., button clicks, so it’s great for building the frontend of websites. However, Java’s object-oriented nature makes it great for creating robust backends of websites.</p>
<h3 id="memory-management">Memory management</h3>
<p>Java uses automatic garbage collection ****for memory management. So, developers don’t have to worry about managing memory for their apps by themselves. The Java garbage collector cleans up and gets rid of unused memory often. It prevents memory leaks by removing the need for manual memory management. Due to this, Java is a good choice for backend systems that need to be scalable and stable.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/memory-management-tdg2z.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Developers had to handle memory management themselves in earlier versions of JavaScript. However, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_management" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">modern JavaScript engines</a> like V8 now have good garbage collection systems. These updates improve memory management and make apps and websites run faster. It also enables developers to focus on how to write code rather than on memory issues.</p>
<h3 id="cross-platform-support">Cross-platform support</h3>
<p>Although both Java and JavaScript support different platforms, they provide good cross-platform compatibility. Java is a platform-independent language because it runs on the Java platform. Any device with an installed Java Virtual Machine can run the Java code you write. It is great for developers because they can write their code once and use it anywhere.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cross-platform-support-ck38q.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In contrast, JavaScript operates in web browsers. It is easy to use on all devices and platforms without extra setup. Any device can run your JavaScript code as long as it has a web browser. Also, with tools like Node.js, you can now use JavaScript for server-side development. It makes it easy for a full stack developer to work with JavaScript on frontend and backend projects. Thanks to Node.js, JavaScript can run on many platforms past the browser, e.g., Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>

<p>Before looking at these features in detail, let’s take a closer look at these two programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.java.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Java</a> is a high-level, object-oriented, and class-based programming language developed in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to have as few implementation details as possible, and it is widely used for building applications across a range of platforms such as mobile, desktop, web, and enterprise systems. Java follows the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA) philosophy, which means compiled Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
<h2 id="core-features-of-java">Core features of Java</h2>
<p>Below are the core features of Java that make it a powerhouse for building a range of applications:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/core-features-of-java-hjs55.png" alt="Java features"></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-python">Disadvantages of Python</h2>
<p>While Python’s simple and yet elegant syntax makes it a general-purpose language for building all sorts of applications, there are some limitations to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python’s use of an interpreter makes it slower when compared to a compiled language like Java.</li>
<li>Python uses Global Interpreter Lock, a mechanism that allows only a single thread to access the interpreter, which makes it not suitable for resource-intensive applications that need to run multiple threads.</li>
<li>Python has limited support for mobile development.</li>
<li>Python’s dynamic typing and ease of use can lead to higher memory consumption.</li>
<li>The dynamic typing of Python means errors only appear at runtime, which can cause issues in larger projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Java and Python come with a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for building various applications across devices and platforms. But how do you decide which one is the right fit for you? Let’s dive into a side-by-side comparison of these two popular languages to help you make an informed choice.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Java is faster than Python because it uses a compiler that compiles Java code into bytecode that the JVM then executes. The JVM also supports Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, a program that converts bytecode into native code during the execution of a program, significantly improving performance.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, uses an interpreter to execute Python code line by line. This approach introduces latency, which can impact application performance. Furthermore, Python is dynamically typed, meaning type-checking happens at runtime, which can further affect speed.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re building a financial application that requires real-time support, low latency, and performance at scale, Java is the better choice compared to Python. However, if your focus is on development speed rather than raw performance, then Python is a more suitable option.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management">Memory management</h2>
<p>Java uses garbage collection within the JVM to automatically manage the allocations and deallocation of memory. The allocation mechanism makes it an ideal choice for applications that require long runtimes. However, Java also tends to consume more memory because of the JVM.</p>
<p>Python also uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory. Although memory handling is simpler, the Global Interpreter Lock can limit multithreading, especially in CPU-intensive tasks.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>
<p>Concurrency is important for building applications that require running multi-threaded environments where tasks are executed in parallel (like web servers, real-time banking systems, and stock trading platforms). Both Java and Python handle concurrency differently due to their design philosophies, threading models, and runtime environments.</p>
<p>Java handles multi-threading through the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> class and <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package, which maps directly to the operating system threads and enables better use of the processor. Furthermore, the JVM also minimizes latency in concurrent tasks, which makes it a perfect programming language for building CPU-heavy applications.</p>
<p>Python also provides a high-level interface for working with threads. It uses events and coroutines to enable running tasks in parallel. As compared to Java, Python’s GIL limits the CPU-bound task and can result in higher overhead.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes what to consider when choosing either Java or Python for CPU-heavy tasks:</p>








































<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Feature</strong></th><th><strong>Java</strong></th><th><strong>Python</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Concurrency Model</strong></td><td>Multi-threading, parallelism</td><td>Threads, processes, asynchronous I/O</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>Better for CPU-bound tasks</td><td>Better for I/O-bound tasks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ease of Use</strong></td><td>Complex</td><td>Simplified</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ecosystem</strong></td><td>Extensive libraries, enterprise-ready</td><td>Lightweight, flexible options</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scalability</strong></td><td>High for multi-core systems</td><td>Limited for CPU-bound tasks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best Fit</strong></td><td>High-performance and real-time systems</td><td>Web scraping, data pipelines</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2 id="java-vs-python-error-handling">Java vs. Python: Error handling</h2>
<p>Java has a robust error-handling mechanism that makes it a perfect choice for enterprise applications that demand high reliability and predictability. Java uses checked and unchecked exceptions, Try-Catch-Finally block, and custom exceptions by extending the <code>Exception</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code> classes. These options make error handling predictable and enable precise error handling.</p>

<p>In comparison, Java enforces handling certain exceptions at compile time, while Python does not differentiate between checked and unchecked exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="java-vs-python-learning-curve">Java vs. Python: Learning curve</h2>
<p>Java has a steeper learning curve than Python. Factors like syntax, complexity, programming principles, and practical applications affect the adoption of these two languages. Beginners often find Java’s code verbose because it requires explicit declaration for variable types and methods, which can sometimes be difficult for both beginners and experts to read. For example, a simple “Hello World!” program in Java requires defining a class and a main method:</p>

<h2 id="java-vs-python-cross-platform-support">Java vs. Python: Cross-platform support</h2>
<p>Both Java and Python are cross-platform compatible, but they approach this in slightly different ways. Java’s WORA philosophy ensures that Java programs run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more, as long as the JVM is installed. Java also offers the Android SDK for mobile app development and frameworks like Swing and JavaFX for building desktop applications.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, supports cross-platform compatibility provided the interpreter is installed on the platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.). Once you install the interpreter, the same code can run across multiple platforms without compilation.</p>
<p>While Python has frameworks like Tkinter and PyQt for building desktop applications, these tend to be less consistent across platforms compared to Java-based frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="java-vs-python-use-cases">Java vs. Python: Use cases</h2>
<p>Java and Python each have unique strengths and ecosystems tailored to specific types of projects.</p>
<p>Java’s robustness, scalability, and high performance make it a top choice for enterprise-grade applications such as banking and financial systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools, and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms. It’s also widely adopted in areas like big data and distributed systems (e.g., Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark), game development (e.g., LibGDX and jMonkeyEngine), and embedded systems (e.g., Java ME).</p>
<p>Python, with its simplicity, readable syntax, and versatility, shines in data science and machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn), as well as automation and scripting tasks. While Python offers frameworks like Pygame for game development and Kivy for mobile app development, these are not as robust or scalable as Java-based frameworks for large-scale projects.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-javascript-and-typescript">What are JavaScript and TypeScript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a simple and versatile programming language, and probably the most widely used in web development. It supports dynamic typing and works on both the frontend and backend. If you’re aiming to become a web developer, you should be comfortable with using JavaScript.</p>
<p>TypeScript, on the other hand, is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and some features that JavaScript doesn’t offer out of the box. It was designed to solve specific problems that JavaScript developers face and make JavaScript development more efficient. Since valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript, it’s easy to start using. TypeScript helps make codebases more robust and maintainable, especially as projects grow. Its type system is great for catching bugs early and making the development process smoother overall.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-javascript">Features of JavaScript</h2>
<p>Some of the key features of JavaScript include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dynamic typing</strong>: In JavaScript, you do not have to declare variables with any type. The types can also change during runtime.</li>

<h2 id="features-of-typescript">Features of TypeScript</h2>
<p>Some of the key features of TypeScript include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static typing</strong>: Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript supports static typing. When defining a variable or object, you can specify the type you want it to have. This helps you catch errors at compile time rather than run time.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">let</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> programmingLanguage</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">:</span><span style="color:#8BE9FD;font-style:italic"> string</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> =</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> "</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">TypeScript</span><span style="color:#E9F284">"</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span>

<p>The code snippet demonstrates how to define a variable in TypeScript. You can also do this without explicitly specifying the type string; TypeScript will infer the type implicitly. You can notice the effect of the static type on the following line, where a number is assigned to the variable. This will show a compile error because the variable was initialized as a string.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Interfaces</strong>: Interfaces allow you to define an object’s structure and ensure that the structure is respected wherever you use that object. The code below defines an interface and creates an object based on the interface structure.</li>

<h2 id="when-should-you-use-typescript-or-javascript">When should you use TypeScript or JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Choosing between TypeScript and JavaScript depends on several factors such as the kind of project, if you are working in a team or alone, and so on. Knowing which to choose for your project will enhance your productivity. I will provide you with a guide on when to choose TypeScript over JavaScript and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>When JavaScript is enough</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Small projects or quick prototypes</strong>: JavaScript is suitable when you want to quickly test an idea or build small projects where static typing is not needed. It removes the compilation step that TypeScript has, leading to a faster development process.</li>
</ol>
<p>I once worked on a project to build a static website for a drug store using TypeScript, thinking it would give me an extra layer of safety and structure. But as I got into the development process, I realized I was spending so much time fixing type errors, tweaking interfaces, and trying to make the compiler happy, rather than focusing on the core logic of the app.</p>
<p>In a project where speed and simplicity were the goals, TypeScript started to feel like a roadblock rather than a benefit. The experience taught me that for smaller projects, TypeScript can be a bit of an overkill. JavaScript does the job faster.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Learning purposes</strong>: If you are new to programming or want to learn new concepts, JavaScript is enough. It helps you grasp the fundamentals without the extra layer of static typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working solo</strong>: Whenever I work alone, I use JavaScript because it is effective for small projects and I’m familiar with its data interactions. JavaScript should be enough if you are working alone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/working-on-a-solo-project-using-javascript-biffe.png" alt="Working with JavaScript"></p>
<p><strong>When TypeScript is a great fit</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Large projects with multiple developers</strong>: TypeScript is a great fit for large projects with multiple developers. Its typing system helps you write code that is easier to read, manage, and debug.</li>
</ol>
<p>I worked on a project where built a fairly large and growing codebase entirely in JavaScript. At first, everything seemed to move quickly, and we could iterate fast. But as the project scaled, we started having problems.</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating issues we ran into was type-related bugs. Debugging those bugs was painful. We’d waste a lot of time trying to find the error, only to find out that it was a function receiving the wrong data shape, something TypeScript could have caught during development. The experience proved how valuable static typing can be for large-scale applications.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>When code maintainability is a priority</strong>: Applications where code maintainability is crucial benefit from TypeScript type checking. You can detect errors during compile time instead of during run time. Many IDEs like Visual Studio Code support type checking and will notify you of any type mismatch while coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When dealing with strict API contracts</strong>: If you are making requests to an API endpoint with a strict structure, TypeScript’s type system helps to model the return of the endpoint using an Interface or Type and avoids throwing exceptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In my early career days, I had the task to implement a feature to fetch the price of some vehicles using the vehicleIds. It involved calling the price REST endpoint. I used JavaScript’s fetch to do this. Everything looked right - the request went out, the response came back, and I tried working with the data. But then, it threw an exception at runtime.</p>
<p>I was confused because I was sure I’d handled everything correctly. After spending some time reading the API documentation, I realized the issue was in how I was handling the response. The API returned something slightly different from what I expected, and JavaScript didn’t give any warning, it just failed when I tried to use the data.</p>
<p>Later, when I was faced with the same kind of problem using TypeScript, it was a better experience. With TypeScript, I was forced to define the expected response type up front. If I tried to access a field that didn’t exist, the compiler will immediately flag it.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>When working with frameworks like Angular</strong>: <a href="https://roadmap.sh/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a> is a popular web development framework and is built on TypeScript. So if you want to work with Angular, then using TypeScript is a must.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-typescript-hard-to-learn-if-you-know-javascript">Is TypeScript hard to learn if you know JavaScript?</h2>
<p>If you already know JavaScript, it’s not hard to learn TypeScript. As explained in the previous section, TypeScript is JavaScript with static typing, so most of your JavaScript knowledge still applies. It was relatively easy for me to pick up TypeScript because I had been using JavaScript for a long time.</p>
<p>The typical learning curve challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting used to explicit typing</strong>: Explicitly defining types for variables or objects might be challenging at first, but over time, you see the benefit and get used to it. The common data types in TypeScript are boolean, string, and number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling type errors</strong>: One of the advantages of TypeScript is that you can see type errors while coding. It can be tricky at first when you see a type error message, but read the error message carefully, and you will be able to make sense of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generics</strong>: This was one of the most confusing aspects of TypeScript for me. Generics help create reusable and flexible types and make your code more generic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">const</span><span style="color:#50FA7B"> generic</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> =</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> &#x3C;</span><span style="color:#FFB86C;font-style:italic">T</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">>(</span><span style="color:#FFB86C;font-style:italic">arg</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">:</span><span style="color:#8BE9FD;font-style:italic"> T</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">)</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">:</span><span style="color:#8BE9FD;font-style:italic"> T</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> =></span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> console.</span><span style="color:#50FA7B">log</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">(arg);</span></span>

<p>The code snippet shows a function that takes arguments of different types and logs the argument to the console. This is the power of generics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting up configurations</strong>: You will also have to get used to setting up a tsconfig file. A tsconfig file is a configuration file that tells the compiler how to compile TypeScript into JavaScript. It’s usually confusing at first, but you’ll get used to it over time by reading the documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interfaces and Types</strong>: With Interfaces and Types, you can define the shape of an object. At first, I was confused about when to use an Interface or a Type because they can be used interchangeably. Yes, while they are alike, they have a slight difference. An Interface can be extended with new properties, but a Type cannot. I recommend taking a look at the TypeScript <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a> for this.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="typescript-vs-javascript-for-frontend-and-backend">TypeScript vs. JavaScript for frontend and backend</h2>
<p>Are you caught in between choosing either TypeScript or JavaScript for either backend or frontend development? You can use TypeScript and JavaScript for both frontend and backend development. However, as you have seen in the previous sections, TypeScript is suitable for large-scale applications, while JavaScript is suitable for small projects.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at frontend and backend development using JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>
<p><strong>Frontend development: TypeScript vs. JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">frontend</a> is the visual part of an application that users interact with. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or TypeScript. Popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/react" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/vue" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and Angular also make frontend development easier.</p>
<p>JavaScript is the default language of the web. It is compatible with every browser and is used for web development. However, due to its lack of static typing, it is used for smaller frontend projects and small React applications. Whenever I want to build a small project with React, I opt for JavaScript because I develop faster and don’t have to worry about types.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TypeScript is used for large-scale frontend applications. It is easier to scale and maintain a frontend application written in TypeScript than with JavaScript. The popular frameworks support TypeScript, but it is required for Angular, which does not support JavaScript.</p>
<p>I worked on a large-scale React project that was initially built with JavaScript. We ran into a log of bugs, and debugging was a nightmare. It was also quite difficult to debug state management using MobX. We switched to TypeScript, and debugging became easier. The code was also maintainable, thereby increasing developer productivity.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/frontend-development-using-js-and-ts-ljqba.png" alt="Frontend development with JS and TS"></p>
<p><strong>Backend development: TypeScript vs. JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>The backend of an application handles the non-visual parts, such as the business logic, database, authentication logic, and APIs. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/nodejs" target="_blank">Node.js</a> is the common runtime environment that helps developers run JavaScript and TypeScript in the backend.</p>
<p>JavaScript is more common in quick Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or prototypes using frameworks like Express.js, where a fast development cycle is a priority. You don’t need extra setups to get started, and you don’t need to worry about typing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TypeScript brings better scalability, maintainability, and reliability to backend development. It supports Object-Oriented Programming and is best suited for building enterprise applications. It also supports static typing and avoids runtime errors, making backend services more reliable.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-learn-typescript-or-javascript-first">Should you learn TypeScript or JavaScript first?</h2>
<p>I work with TypeScript on a daily basis, expanding my knowledge of its features and looking for better ways to use the language. My experience has been enjoyable so far. However, before I got comfortable with TypeScript, I had worked with JavaScript for many years.</p>
<p>If you are new to web development, I recommend you start with JavaScript. Having a strong foundation of JavaScript will make it easier to grasp TypeScript. Then, after getting comfortable with JavaScript, you can pick up TypeScript and practice it by building small projects.</p>
<p>If you already know the basics of TypeScript and you are working in a team or a large code base, you should use TypeScript because of its advantages, such as static typing and maintainability.</p>
<h2 id="will-typescript-replace-javascript">Will TypeScript replace JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Many people, especially newbies, always ask if TypeScript will replace JavaScript. Well, the simple answer is no. JavaScript is not going anywhere. Although TypeScript shares many of the properties of JavaScript and adds some benefits like static typing, it still compiles to plain JavaScript because web browsers cannot execute TypeScript code. So, JavaScript is still very much needed.</p>
<p>However, many teams are migrating to TypeScript because of better tooling, scalability, and maintainability. Also, more frameworks, such as Vue and Next.js, are providing support for TypeScript.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of TypeScript, JavaScript will still be the foundation and relevant in the future.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>In this guide, we’ve seen the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript. For many developers, JavaScript is their go-to language because of its simplicity and low entry barrier. It is ideal for building small and responsive web and mobile apps, building prototypes, or experimenting with new programming concepts. JavaScript has a large ecosystem. With so many libraties and frameworks, it’s easy to find tools that suit your needs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TypeScript is an excellent choice if you are working on a large-scale project with multiple developers. As your project grows, having a strong type system provides huge benefits such as catching errors early, enforcing consistent data structures, and reduce runtime bugs. TypeScript provides developers with great tooling such as code completion, navigation and refactoring suggestions.</p>
<p>However, I recommend you learn both JavaScript and TypeScript and use them based on the project you are working on. roadmap.sh offers structured <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://roadmap.sh/typescript" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> roadmaps where you can track and share your progress on your profile. You can also customize your roadmap based on your learning needs.</p>`,Er={title:"TypeScript vs JavaScript: Which to Choose For Your Project",description:"TypeScript vs JavaScript: Learn the pros, cons, and best use cases to choose the right language for your next project.",authorId:"william",excludedBySlug:"/javascript/vs-typescript",seo:{title:"TypeScript vs JavaScript: Which to Choose For Your Project",description:"TypeScript vs JavaScript: Learn the pros, cons, and best use cases to choose the right language for your next project.",ogImageUrl:"https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/typescript-or-javascript-99fzl.jpg"},isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","textual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},qr="/workspace/src/data/guides/javascript-vs-typescript.md",jr=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=Er;return e.file=qr,e.url=jr,l`${p()}${r(Br())}`});const Pr=()=>`<p>HTTP is the protocol that every web developer should know as it powers the whole web and knowing it is definitely going to help you develop better applications. In this guide, I am going to be discussing what HTTP is, how it came to be, where it is today and how did we get here.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP?</h3>
<p>First things first, what is HTTP? HTTP is the <code>TCP/IP</code> based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet. By application layer protocol, I mean it’s just an abstraction layer that standardizes how the hosts (clients and servers) communicate and itself it depends upon <code>TCP/IP</code> to get request and response between the client and server. By default TCP port <code>80</code> is used but other ports can be used as well. HTTPS, however, uses port <code>443</code>.</p>
<h3 id="http09--the-one-liner-1991">HTTP/0.9 – The One Liner (1991)</h3>
<p>The first documented version of HTTP was <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><code>HTTP/0.9</code></a> which was put forward in 1991. It was the simplest protocol ever; having a single method called <code>GET</code>. If a client had to access some webpage on the server, it would have made the simple request like below</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">GET /index.html</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the response from server would have looked as follows</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">(response body) (connection closed)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That is, the server would get the request, reply with the HTML in response and as soon as the content has been transferred, the connection will be closed. There were</p>
<ul>
<li>No headers</li>
<li><code>GET</code> was the only allowed method</li>
<li>Response had to be HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the protocol really had nothing more than being a stepping stone for what was to come.</p>
<h3 id="http10---1996">HTTP/1.0 - 1996</h3>
<p>In 1996, the next version of HTTP i.e. <code>HTTP/1.0</code> evolved that vastly improved over the original version.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>HTTP/0.9</code> which was only designed for HTML response, <code>HTTP/1.0</code> could now deal with other response formats i.e. images, video files, plain text or any other content type as well. It added more methods (i.e. <code>POST</code> and <code>HEAD</code>), request/response formats got changed, HTTP headers got added to both the request and responses, status codes were added to identify the response, character set support was introduced, multi-part types, authorization, caching, content encoding and more was included.</p>
<p>Here is how a sample <code>HTTP/1.0</code> request and response might have looked like:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">GET / HTTP/1.0 Host: kamranahmed.info User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Mac OS X 10_10_5) Accept: */*</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, alongside the request, client has also sent its personal information, required response type etc. While in <code>HTTP/0.9</code> client could never send such information because there were no headers.</p>
<p>Example response to the request above may have looked like below</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">HTTP/1.0 200 OK Content-Type: text/plain Content-Length: 137582 Expires: Thu, 05</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Dec 1997 16:00:00 GMT Last-Modified: Wed, 5 August 1996 15:55:28 GMT Server:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">Apache 0.84 (response body) (connection closed)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the very beginning of the response there is <code>HTTP/1.0</code> (HTTP followed by the version number), then there is the status code <code>200</code> followed by the reason phrase (or description of the status code, if you will).</p>
<p>In this newer version, request and response headers were still kept as <code>ASCII</code> encoded, but the response body could have been of any type i.e. image, video, HTML, plain text or any other content type. So, now that server could send any content type to the client; not so long after the introduction, the term “Hyper Text” in <code>HTTP</code> became misnomer. <code>HMTP</code> or Hypermedia transfer protocol might have made more sense but, I guess, we are stuck with the name for life.</p>
<p>One of the major drawbacks of <code>HTTP/1.0</code> were you couldn’t have multiple requests per connection. That is, whenever a client will need something from the server, it will have to open a new TCP connection and after that single request has been fulfilled, connection will be closed. And for any next requirement, it will have to be on a new connection. Why is it bad? Well, let’s assume that you visit a webpage having <code>10</code> images, <code>5</code> stylesheets and <code>5</code> javascript files, totalling to <code>20</code> items that needs to fetched when request to that webpage is made. Since the server closes the connection as soon as the request has been fulfilled, there will be a series of <code>20</code> separate connections where each of the items will be served one by one on their separate connections. This large number of connections results in a serious performance hit as requiring a new <code>TCP</code> connection imposes a significant performance penalty because of three-way handshake followed by slow-start.</p>
<h4 id="three-way-handshake">Three-way Handshake</h4>
<p>Three-way handshake in its simplest form is that all the <code>TCP</code> connections begin with a three-way handshake in which the client and the server share a series of packets before starting to share the application data.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SYN</code> - Client picks up a random number, let’s say <code>x</code>, and sends it to the server.</li>
<li><code>SYN ACK</code> - Server acknowledges the request by sending an <code>ACK</code> packet back to the client which is made up of a random number, let’s say <code>y</code> picked up by server and the number <code>x+1</code> where <code>x</code> is the number that was sent by the client</li>
<li><code>ACK</code> - Client increments the number <code>y</code> received from the server and sends an <code>ACK</code> packet back with the number <code>y+1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the three-way handshake is completed, the data sharing between the client and server may begin. It should be noted that the client may start sending the application data as soon as it dispatches the last <code>ACK</code> packet but the server will still have to wait for the <code>ACK</code> packet to be received in order to fulfill the request.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uERG2G2.png" alt="Three-way Handshake"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that there is a minor issue with the image, the last <code>ACK</code> packet sent by the client to end the handshake contains only <code>y+1</code> i.e. it should have been <code>ACK:y+1</code> instead of <code>ACK: x+1, y+1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, some implementations of <code>HTTP/1.0</code> tried to overcome this issue by introducing a new header called <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> which was meant to tell the server “Hey server, do not close this connection, I need it again”. But still, it wasn’t that widely supported and the problem still persisted.</p>
<p>Apart from being connection-less, <code>HTTP</code> also is a stateless protocol i.e. server doesn’t maintain the information about the client and so each of the requests has to have the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request on its own without any association with any old requests. And so this adds fuel to the fire i.e. apart from the large number of connections that the client has to open, it also has to send some redundant data on the wire causing increased bandwidth usage.</p>
<h3 id="http11---1999">HTTP/1.1 - 1999</h3>
<p>After merely 3 years of <code>HTTP/1.0</code>, the next version i.e. <code>HTTP/1.1</code> was released in 1999; which made a lot of improvements over its predecessor. The major improvements over <code>HTTP/1.0</code> included</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>New HTTP methods</strong> were added, which introduced <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>DELETE</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hostname Identification</strong> In <code>HTTP/1.0</code> <code>Host</code> header wasn’t required but <code>HTTP/1.1</code> made it required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent Connections</strong> As discussed above, in <code>HTTP/1.0</code> there was only one request per connection and the connection was closed as soon as the request was fulfilled which resulted in acute performance hit and latency problems. <code>HTTP/1.1</code> introduced the persistent connections i.e. <strong>connections weren’t closed by default</strong> and were kept open which allowed multiple sequential requests. To close the connections, the header <code>Connection: close</code> had to be available on the request. Clients usually send this header in the last request to safely close the connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipelining</strong> It also introduced the support for pipelining, where the client could send multiple requests to the server without waiting for the response from server on the same connection and server had to send the response in the same sequence in which requests were received. But how does the client know that this is the point where first response download completes and the content for next response starts, you may ask! Well, to solve this, there must be <code>Content-Length</code> header present which clients can use to identify where the response ends and it can start waiting for the next response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that in order to benefit from persistent connections or pipelining, <code>Content-Length</code> header must be available on the response, because this would let the client know when the transmission completes and it can send the next request (in normal sequential way of sending requests) or start waiting for the next response (when pipelining is enabled).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there was still an issue with this approach. And that is, what if the data is dynamic and server cannot find the content length before hand? Well in that case, you really can’t benefit from persistent connections, could you?! In order to solve this <code>HTTP/1.1</code> introduced chunked encoding. In such cases server may omit content-Length in favor of chunked encoding (more to it in a moment). However, if none of them are available, then the connection must be closed at the end of request.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chunked Transfers</strong> In case of dynamic content, when the server cannot really find out the <code>Content-Length</code> when the transmission starts, it may start sending the content in pieces (chunk by chunk) and add the <code>Content-Length</code> for each chunk when it is sent. And when all of the chunks are sent i.e. whole transmission has completed, it sends an empty chunk i.e. the one with <code>Content-Length</code> set to zero in order to identify the client that transmission has completed. In order to notify the client about the chunked transfer, server includes the header <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code></p>

<p>I am not going to dwell about all the <code>HTTP/1.1</code> features in this post as it is a topic in itself and you can already find a lot about it. The one such document that I would recommend you to read is <a href="https://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www8/data/2136/pdf/pd1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Key differences between <code>HTTP/1.0</code> and HTTP/1.1</a> and here is the link to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">original RFC</a> for the overachievers.</p>
<p><code>HTTP/1.1</code> was introduced in 1999 and it had been a standard for many years. Although, it improved a lot over its predecessor; with the web changing everyday, it started to show its age. Loading a web page these days is more resource-intensive than it ever was. A simple webpage these days has to open more than 30 connections. Well <code>HTTP/1.1</code> has persistent connections, then why so many connections? you say! The reason is, in <code>HTTP/1.1</code> it can only have one outstanding connection at any moment of time. <code>HTTP/1.1</code> tried to fix this by introducing pipelining but it didn’t completely address the issue because of the <strong>head-of-line blocking</strong> where a slow or heavy request may block the requests behind and once a request gets stuck in a pipeline, it will have to wait for the next requests to be fulfilled. To overcome these shortcomings of <code>HTTP/1.1</code>, the developers started implementing the workarounds, for example use of spritesheets, encoded images in CSS, single humongous CSS/Javascript files, <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/domain-sharding-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">domain sharding</a> etc.</p>
<h3 id="spdy---2009">SPDY - 2009</h3>
<p>Google went ahead and started experimenting with alternative protocols to make the web faster and improving web security while reducing the latency of web pages. In 2009, they announced <code>SPDY</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>SPDY</code> is a trademark of Google and isn’t an acronym.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was seen that if we keep increasing the bandwidth, the network performance increases in the beginning but a point comes when there is not much of a performance gain. But if you do the same with latency i.e. if we keep dropping the latency, there is a constant performance gain. This was the core idea for performance gain behind <code>SPDY</code>, decrease the latency to increase the network performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who don’t know the difference, latency is the delay i.e. how long it takes for data to travel between the source and destination (measured in milliseconds) and bandwidth is the amount of data transferred per second (bits per second).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The features of <code>SPDY</code> included, multiplexing, compression, prioritization, security etc. I am not going to get into the details of SPDY, as you will get the idea when we get into the nitty gritty of <code>HTTP/2</code> in the next section as I said <code>HTTP/2</code> is mostly inspired from SPDY.</p>
<p><code>SPDY</code> didn’t really try to replace HTTP; it was a translation layer over HTTP which existed at the application layer and modified the request before sending it over to the wire. It started to become a defacto standards and majority of browsers started implementing it.</p>
<p>In 2015, at Google, they didn’t want to have two competing standards and so they decided to merge it into HTTP while giving birth to <code>HTTP/2</code> and deprecating SPDY.</p>
<h3 id="http2---2015">HTTP/2 - 2015</h3>
<p>By now, you must be convinced that why we needed another revision of the HTTP protocol. <code>HTTP/2</code> was designed for low latency transport of content. The key features or differences from the old version of <code>HTTP/1.1</code> include</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary instead of Textual</li>
<li>Multiplexing - Multiple asynchronous HTTP requests over a single connection</li>
<li>Header compression using HPACK</li>
<li>Server Push - Multiple responses for single request</li>
<li>Request Prioritization</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S85j8gg.png" alt="HTTP Model"></p>
<h4 id="1-binary-protocol">1. Binary Protocol</h4>
<p><code>HTTP/2</code> tends to address the issue of increased latency that existed in HTTP/1.x by making it a binary protocol. Being a binary protocol, it easier to parse but unlike <code>HTTP/1.x</code> it is no longer readable by the human eye. The major building blocks of <code>HTTP/2</code> are Frames and Streams</p>
<h5 id="frames-and-streams">Frames and Streams</h5>
<p>HTTP messages are now composed of one or more frames. There is a <code>HEADERS</code> frame for the meta data and <code>DATA</code> frame for the payload and there exist several other types of frames (<code>HEADERS</code>, <code>DATA</code>, <code>RST_STREAM</code>, <code>SETTINGS</code>, <code>PRIORITY</code> etc) that you can check through <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#iana-frames" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the <code>HTTP/2</code> specs</a>.</p>
<p>Every <code>HTTP/2</code> request and response is given a unique stream ID and it is divided into frames. Frames are nothing but binary pieces of data. A collection of frames is called a Stream. Each frame has a stream id that identifies the stream to which it belongs and each frame has a common header. Also, apart from stream ID being unique, it is worth mentioning that, any request initiated by client uses odd numbers and the response from server has even numbers stream IDs.</p>
<p>Apart from the <code>HEADERS</code> and <code>DATA</code>, another frame type that I think worth mentioning here is <code>RST_STREAM</code> which is a special frame type that is used to abort some stream i.e. client may send this frame to let the server know that I don’t need this stream anymore. In <code>HTTP/1.1</code> the only way to make the server stop sending the response to client was closing the connection which resulted in increased latency because a new connection had to be opened for any consecutive requests. While in HTTP/2, client can use <code>RST_STREAM</code> and stop receiving a specific stream while the connection will still be open and the other streams will still be in play.</p>
<h4 id="2-multiplexing">2. Multiplexing</h4>
<p>Since <code>HTTP/2</code> is now a binary protocol and as I said above that it uses frames and streams for requests and responses, once a TCP connection is opened, all the streams are sent asynchronously through the same connection without opening any additional connections. And in turn, the server responds in the same asynchronous way i.e. the response has no order and the client uses the assigned stream id to identify the stream to which a specific packet belongs. This also solves the <strong>head-of-line blocking</strong> issue that existed in HTTP/1.x i.e. the client will not have to wait for the request that is taking time and other requests will still be getting processed.</p>
<h4 id="3-hpack-header-compression">3. HPACK Header Compression</h4>
<p>It was part of a separate RFC which was specifically aimed at optimizing the sent headers. The essence of it is that when we are constantly accessing the server from a same client there is a lot of redundant data that we are sending in the headers over and over, and sometimes there might be cookies increasing the headers size which results in bandwidth usage and increased latency. To overcome this, <code>HTTP/2</code> introduced header compression.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3IPWXvR.png" alt="Header Compression"></p>
<p>Unlike request and response, headers are not compressed in <code>gzip</code> or <code>compress</code> etc formats but there is a different mechanism in place for header compression which is literal values are encoded using Huffman code and a headers table is maintained by the client and server and both the client and server omit any repetitive headers (e.g. user agent etc) in the subsequent requests and reference them using the headers table maintained by both.</p>
<p>While we are talking headers, let me add here that the headers are still the same as in HTTP/1.1, except for the addition of some pseudo headers i.e. <code>:method</code>, <code>:scheme</code>, <code>:host</code> and <code>:path</code></p>
<h4 id="4-server-push">4. Server Push</h4>
<p>Server push is another tremendous feature of <code>HTTP/2</code> where the server, knowing that the client is going to ask for a certain resource, can push it to the client without even client asking for it. For example, let’s say a browser loads a web page, it parses the whole page to find out the remote content that it has to load from the server and then sends consequent requests to the server to get that content.</p>
<p>Server push allows the server to decrease the round trips by pushing the data that it knows that client is going to demand. How it is done is, server sends a special frame called <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> notifying the client that, “Hey, I am about to send this resource to you! Do not ask me for it.” The <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> frame is associated with the stream that caused the push to happen and it contains the promised stream ID i.e. the stream on which the server will send the resource to be pushed.</p>
<h4 id="5-request-prioritization">5. Request Prioritization</h4>
<p>A client can assign a priority to a stream by including the prioritization information in the <code>HEADERS</code> frame by which a stream is opened. At any other time, client can send a <code>PRIORITY</code> frame to change the priority of a stream.</p>
<p>Without any priority information, server processes the requests asynchronously i.e. without any order. If there is priority assigned to a stream, then based on this prioritization information, server decides how much of the resources need to be given to process which request.</p>
<h4 id="6-security">6. Security</h4>
<p>There was extensive discussion on whether security (through <code>TLS</code>) should be made mandatory for <code>HTTP/2</code> or not. In the end, it was decided not to make it mandatory. However, most vendors stated that they will only support <code>HTTP/2</code> when it is used over <code>TLS</code>. So, although <code>HTTP/2</code> doesn’t require encryption by specs but it has kind of become mandatory by default anyway. With that out of the way, <code>HTTP/2</code> when implemented over <code>TLS</code> does impose some requirements i.e. <code>TLS</code> version <code>1.2</code> or higher must be used, there must be a certain level of minimum key sizes, ephemeral keys are required etc.</p>
<p><code>HTTP/2</code> is here and it has already <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=http2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">surpassed SPDY in adaption</a> which is gradually increasing. <code>HTTP/2</code> has alot to offer in terms of performance gain and it is about time we should start using it.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in further details here is the <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9113.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link to specs</a> and a link <a href="https://www.http2demo.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">demonstrating the performance benefits of <code>HTTP/2</code></a>.</p>

Since the roadmaps are going to be just about the technical knowledge, I thought it would be a good idea to reiterate and have an article on what I think of different seniority roles.</p>
<p>I have seen many organizations decide the seniority of developers by giving more significance to the years of experience than they should. I have seen developers labeled “Junior” doing the work of Senior Developers and I have seen “Lead” developers who weren’t even qualified to be called “Senior”. The seniority of a developer cannot just be decided by their age, years of experience or technical knowledge that they have got. There are other factors in play here — their perception of work, how they interact with their peers and how they approach problems. We discuss these three key factors in detail for each of the seniority levels below.</p>
<h3 id="different-seniority-titles">Different Seniority Titles</h3>
<p>Different organizations might have different seniority titles but they mainly fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior Developer</li>
<li>Mid Level Developer</li>
<li>Senior Developer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="junior-developer">Junior Developer</h3>
<p>Junior developers are normally fresh graduates and it’s either they don’t have or they have minimal industry experience. Not only they have weak coding skills but there are also a few other things that give Junior developers away:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their main mantra is “making it work” without giving much attention to how the solution is achieved. To them, a working software and good software are equivalent.</li>
<li>They usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something. They suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members.</li>
<li>Most of the Junior developers just try to live up to the role and, when stuck, they might leave work for a senior developer instead of at least trying to take a stab at something.</li>
<li>They don’t know about the business side of the company and don’t realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and they don’t realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain.</li>
<li>Over-engineering is a major problem, often leading to fragility and bugs.</li>
<li>When given a problem, they often try to fix just the current problem a.k.a. fixing the symptoms instead of fixing the root problem.</li>
<li>You might notice the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Somebody Else’s Problem</a>” behavior from them.</li>
<li>They don’t know what or how much they don’t know, thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dunning–Kruger effect</a>.</li>
<li>They don’t take initiatives and they might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase.</li>
<li>They don’t participate in team discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a Junior developer in the team is not necessarily a bad thing; since you are just starting out, you are not expected to be a know-it-all person. However, it is your responsibility to learn, gain experience, not get stuck with the “Junior” title and improve yourself. Here are a few tips for Junior developers to help move up the ladder of seniority:</p>
<ul>
<li>All sorts of problems can be solved if you work on them long enough. Do not give up if Stack Overflow or an issue on GitHub doesn’t have an answer. Saying “I am stuck, but I have tried X, Y, and Z. Do you have any pointers?” to your lead is much better than saying “This is beyond me.”</li>
<li>Read a lot of code, not just code in the projects that you are working on, but reference/framework source code, open-source. Ask your fellow developers, perhaps on Reddit too, about the good open-source examples for the language/tools of your choice.</li>
<li>Do personal side-projects, share them with people, contribute to the open-source community. Reach out to people for help. You will be surprised how much support you can get from the community. I still remember my first open-source project on GitHub from around 6 years ago which was a small PHP script (a library) that fetched details for a given address from Google’s Geocoding API. The codebase was super messy, it did not have any tests, did not have any linters or sniffers, and it did not have any CI because I didn’t know about any of this at that time. I am not sure how but one kind soul somehow found the project, forked it, refactored it, “modernized” it, added linting, code sniffing, added CI and opened the pull request. This one pull request taught me so many things that I might have never learned that fast on my own because I was still in college, working for a small service-based company and doing just small websites all on my own without knowing what is right and what is not. This one PR on GitHub was my introduction to open-source and I owe everything to that.</li>
<li>Avoid what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Somebody Else’s Problem Field”</a> behavior.</li>
<li>When given a problem to solve, try to identify the root cause and fix that instead of fixing the symptoms. And remember, not being able to reproduce means not solved. It is solved when you understand why it occurred and why it no longer does.</li>
<li>Have respect for the code that was written before you. Be generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. Understand that code is often ugly and weird for a reason other than incompetence. Learning to live with and thrive with legacy code is a great skill. Never assume anybody is stupid. Instead, figure out how these intelligent, well-intentioned and experienced people have come to a decision that is stupid now. Approach inheriting legacy code with an “opportunity mindset” rather than a complaining one.</li>
<li>It’s okay to not know things. You don’t need to be ashamed of not knowing things already. There are no stupid questions, ask however many questions that would allow you to work effectively.</li>
<li>Don’t let yourself be limited by the job title that you have. Keep working on your self-improvement.</li>
<li>Do your homework. Predict what’s coming down the pipe. Be involved in the team discussions. Even if you are wrong, you will learn something.</li>
<li>Learn about the domain that you are working with. Understand the product end-to-end as an end-user. Do not assume things, ask questions and get things cleared when in doubt.</li>
<li>Learn to communicate effectively - soft skills matter. Learn how to write good emails, how to present your work, how to phrase your questions in a thoughtful manner.</li>
<li>Sit with the senior developers, watch them work, find a mentor. No one likes a know-it-all. Get hold of your ego and be humble enough to take lessons from experienced people.</li>
<li>Don’t just blindly follow the advice of “experts”, take it with a grain of salt.</li>
<li>If you are asked to provide an estimate for some work, do not give an answer unless you have all the details to make a reasonable estimate. If you are forced to do that, pad it 2x or more depending on how much you don’t know about what needs to be done for the task to be marked ‘done’.</li>
<li>Take some time to learn how to use a debugger. Debuggers are quite beneficial when navigating new, undocumented or poorly documented codebase, or to debug weird issues.</li>
<li>Avoid saying “it works on my machine” — yes, I have heard that a lot.</li>
<li>Try to turn any feelings of inadequacy or imposter syndrome into energy to push yourself forward and increase your skills and knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mid-level-developers">Mid Level Developers</h3>
<p>The next level after the Junior developers is Mid Level developers. They are technically stronger than the Junior developers and can work with minimal supervision. They still have some issues to address in order to jump to Senior level.</p>
<p>Intermediate developers are more competent than the Junior developer. They start to see the flaws in their old codebase. They gain the knowledge but they get trapped into the next chain i.e. messing things up while trying to do them “the right way” e.g. hasty abstractions, overuse or unnecessary usage of Design Patterns — they may be able to provide solution faster than the Junior developers but the solution might put you into another rabbit-hole in the long run. Without supervision, they might delay the execution while trying to “do things properly”. They don’t know when to make tradeoffs and they still don’t know when to be dogmatic and when to be pragmatic. They can easily become attached to their solution, become myopic, and be unable to take feedback.</p>
<p>Mid-level developers are quite common. Most of the organizations wrongly label them as “Senior Developers”. However, they need further mentoring in order to become Senior Developers. The next section describes the responsibilities of a senior developer and how you can become one.</p>
<h3 id="senior-developers">Senior Developers</h3>
<p>Senior developers are the next level after the Mid-level developers. They are the people who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road. They are more mature, have gained experience by delivering both good and bad software in the past and have learned from it — they know how to be pragmatic. Here is the list of things that are normally expected of a Senior Developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>With their past experiences, mistakes made, issues faced by over-designed or under-designed software, they can foresee the problems and persuade the direction of the codebase or the architecture.</li>
<li>They don’t have a “Shiny-Toy” syndrome. They are pragmatic in the execution. They can make the tradeoffs when required, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic.</li>
<li>They have a good picture of the field, know what the best tool for the job is in most cases (even if they don’t know the tool). They have the innate ability to pick up a new tool/language/paradigm/etc in order to solve a problem that requires it.</li>
<li>They are aware they’re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs to taking un-glorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done.</li>
<li>They have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development.</li>
<li>They don’t make empty complaints, they make judgments based on the empirical evidence and they have suggestions for solutions.</li>
<li>They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code.</li>
<li>They have the ability to take on large ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract, and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them.</li>
<li>They have respect for the code that was written before them. They are generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. They approach inheriting legacy code with an “opportunity mindset” rather than a complaining one.</li>
<li>They know how to give feedback without hurting anyone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All teams are made up of a mix of all these seniority roles. Being content with your role is a bad thing and you should always strive to improve yourself for the next step. This article is based on my beliefs and observations in the industry. Lots of companies care more for the years of experience to decide the seniority which is a crappy metric — you don’t gain experience just by spending years. You gain it by continuously solving different sorts of problems, irrespective of the number of years you spend in the industry. I have seen fresh graduates having no industry experience get up to speed quickly and producing work of a Senior Engineer and I have seen Senior developers labeled “senior” merely because of their age and “years of experience”.</p>
<p>The most important traits that you need to have in order to step up in your career are: not settling with mediocrity, having an open mindset, being humble, learning from your mistakes, working on the challenging problems and having an opportunity mindset rather than a complaining one.</p>
<p>With that said, this post comes to an end. What are your thoughts on the levels of seniority of developers? Feel free to send improvements to this guide.

<h2 id="proxy-server">Proxy Server</h2>
<p><strong><em>Every web request which is sent from the client to a web server goes through some type of proxy server.</em></strong> A proxy server acts as a gateway between client <em>(you)</em> and the internet and separates end-users from the websites you browse. It replaces the source IP address of the web request with the proxy server’s IP address and then forwards it to the web server. The web server is unaware of the client, it only sees the proxy server.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/proxy/proxy-example.png" alt="Proxy Server Description"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This is not an accurate description but rather just an illustration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proxy servers serve as a single point of control making it easier to enforce security policies. It also provides caching mechanism which stores the requested web pages on the proxy server to improve performance. If the requested web-page is available in cache memory then instead of forwarding the request to the web-server it will send the cached webpage back to the client. This <strong>saves big companies thousands of dollars</strong> by reducing the load on their servers as their website is visited by millions of users every day.</p>
<h2 id="forward-proxy-server">Forward Proxy Server</h2>
<p>A forward proxy is generally implemented on the client side and <strong>sits in front of multiple clients</strong> or client sources. Forward proxy servers are mainly used by companies to <strong>manage the internet usage</strong> of their employees and <strong>restrict content</strong>. It is also used as a <strong>firewall</strong> to secure the company’s network by blocking any request which would pose threat to the company’s network. Proxy servers are also used to <strong>bypass geo-restriction</strong> and browse content that might be blocked in the user’s country. It enables users to <strong>browse anonymously</strong>, as the proxy server masks their details from the website’s servers.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-proxy-server">Reverse Proxy Server</h2>
<p>Reverse proxy servers are implemented on the <strong>server side</strong> instead of the client side. It <strong>sits in front of multiple webservers</strong> and manages incoming requests by forwarding them to the web servers. It provides anonymity for the <strong>back-end web servers and not the client</strong>. Reverse proxy servers are generally used to perform tasks such as <strong>authentication, content caching, and encryption/decryption</strong> on behalf of the web server. These tasks would <strong>hog CPU cycles</strong> on the web server and degrade the performance of the website by introducing a high amount of delay in loading the webpage. Reverse proxies are also used as <strong>load balancers</strong> to distribute the incoming traffic efficiently among the web servers but it is <strong>not optimized</strong> for this task. In essence, a reverse proxy server is a gateway to a web-server or group of web-servers.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A proxy server acts as a gateway between client <em>(you)</em> and the internet and separates end-users from the websites you browse. <strong><em>The position of the proxy server on the network determines whether it is a forward or a reverse proxy server</em></strong>. A Forward proxy is implemented on the client side and <strong>sits in front of multiple clients</strong> or client sources and forwards requests to the web server. Reverse proxy servers are implemented on the <strong>server side</strong> it <strong>sits in front of multiple webservers</strong> and manage the incoming requests by forwarding them to the web servers.</p>
<p>If all this was too much to take in, I have a simple analogy for you.</p>
<p>At a restaurant, the waiter/waitress takes your order and gives it to the kitchen head chef. The head chef then calls out the order and assigns tasks to everyone in the kitchen.</p>
<p>In this analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are the client</li>
<li>Your order is the web request</li>
<li>Waiter/Waitress is your forward proxy server</li>
<li>Kitchen head chef is the reverse proxy server</li>
<li>Other chefs working in the kitchen are the web servers</li>
</ul>

When you open a website, among other things, HTTP is the protocol that helps load the website in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="http-is-stateless">HTTP is Stateless</h2>
<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol which means that each request made from the client to the server is treated as a standalone request; neither the client nor the server keeps track of the subsequent requests. Sessions allow you to change that; with sessions, the server has a way to associate some information with the client so that when the same client requests the server, it can retrieve that information.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will learn what is Session-Based Authentication and how to implement it in Node.js. We also have a separate <a href="/guides/session-authentication">visual guide on Session-Based Authentication</a> as well that explains the topic visually.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-session-based-authentication">What is Session-Based Authentication?</h2>
<p>Session-based authentication is a stateful authentication technique where we use sessions to keep track of the authenticated user. Here is how Session Based Authentication works:</p>
<ul>
<li>User submits the login request for authentication.</li>
<li>Server validates the credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server initiates a session and stores some information about the client. This information can be stored in memory, file system, or database. The server also generates a unique identifier that it can later use to retrieve this session information from the storage. Server sends this unique session identifier to the client.</li>
<li>Client saves the session id in a cookie and this cookie is sent to the server in each request made after the authentication.</li>
<li>Server, upon receiving a request, checks if the session id is present in the request and uses this session id to get information about the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is how session-based authentication works.</p>
<h2 id="session-based-authentication-in-nodejs">Session-Based Authentication in Node.js</h2>
<p>Now that we know what session-based authentication is, let’s see how we can implement session-based authentication in Node.js.</p>
<p>Please note that, for the sake of simplicity, I have intentionally kept the project strictly relevant to the Session Based Authentication and have left out a lot of details that a production-ready application may require. Also, if you don’t want to follow along, project <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/node-session-auth-example" target="_blank">codebase can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>First things first, create an empty directory that will be holding our application.</p>

<p>The important piece to note here is the <code>express-session</code> middleware registration which automatically handles the session initialization, cookie parsing and session data retrieval, and so on. In our example here, we are passing the following configuration options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>secret</code>: This is used to sign the session ID cookie. Using a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session.</li>
<li><code>cookie</code>: Object containing the configuration for session id cookie.</li>
<li><code>resave</code>: Forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session data was never modified during the request.</li>
<li><code>saveUninitialized</code>: Forces an “uninitialized” session to be saved to the store, i.e., saves a session to the store even if the session was not initiated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important option is <code>store</code> which we can configure to change how/where the session data is stored on the server. By default, this data is stored in the memory, i.e., <code>MemoryStore</code>.</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">express-session documentation</a> to learn more about the available options.</p>
<h3 id="creating-handlers">Creating Handlers</h3>
<p>Create a directory called the <code>handlers</code> at the project’s root. This is the directory where we will be placing all the route-handling functions.</p>

<p>At the top of this function, you will notice the check <code>req.session.userid</code>. <code>req.session</code> is automatically populated using the session cookie by the <code>express-session</code> middleware that we registered earlier. <code>req.session.userid</code> is one of the data fields that we will set to store the <code>userid</code> of the logged in user.</p>
<p>Next, we need to register this handler with a route. Open the <code>index.js</code> file at the root of the project and register the following route:</p>

<p>Again, at the top of the function, we are simply checking if we have <code>userid</code> in the session (which means the user is logged in). If the user is logged in, we redirect them to the homepage; if not, we show the login screen. In the login form, we have the method of <code>post</code>, and we submit the form to <code>/process-login</code>. Please note that, for the sake of simplicity, we have a simple HTML string returned in the response, but in a real-world application, you will probably have a separate view file.</p>
<p>Let’s first register this page and then implement <code>/process-login</code> endpoint. Open the <code>index.js</code> file from the root of the project and register the following route:</p>

<span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we are simply checking that the username and password should both be <code>admin</code> and <code>admin</code> for a user to authenticate successfully. Upon finding valid credentials, we set the <code>userid</code> in the session by updating <code>req.session.userid</code>. Similarly, you can set any data in the session. For example, if we wanted to store the user role, we would do the following:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">req.session.role </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">=</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> '</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">admin</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And later access this value out of the session anywhere in the subsequent requests.</p>
<p>Register this route in the <code>index.js</code> file at the root of the project:</p>

<p>Finally, we have the logout functionality. Create a file at <code>handlers/logout.js</code> with the following content:</p>

<p>We reset the session by calling <code>req.session.destroy()</code> and then redirecting the user to the homepage. Register the logout handler in the <code>index.js</code> file using the following:</p>

<h2 id="running-the-application">Running the Application</h2>
<p>Open the <code>package.json</code> file and register the <code>start</code> script as follows:</p>

This process requires minimal to no configuration on your part. Let’s get started!</p>
<p>First and foremost, you need to have a remote server where your web application is deployed. You might have Nginx, Apache, or any other web server. This tutorial will be specific to Nginx or Apache; if you are using another web server, you can go to <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">certbot documentation</a> and get specific instructions for your platform.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>We need to install <code>snapd</code>, which is the package manager that will allow us to install <code>certbot</code> from Let’s Encrypt for automatic renewal. Run the following commands in your terminal.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> apt-get</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> update</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> apt-get</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> install</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> snapd</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> snap</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> install</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> core</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; </span><span style="color:#50FA7B">snap</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> refresh</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> core</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now that <code>snapd</code> is installed, we can install <code>certbot</code> which we will be using to obtain and install the SSL certificate.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> snap</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> install</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --classic</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> certbot</span></span>

<p>Run the following command to verify that <code>certbot</code> is installed.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">certbot</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --version</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="getting-the-ssl-certificate">Getting the SSL Certificate</h2>
<p>Now that <code>certbot</code> is installed, we need to obtain an SSL certificate. The command will ask you for your email address and the domain name for which you want to obtain the SSL certificate. You can also specify multiple domain names if you want to secure multiple domains with a single certificate.</p>
<p>You can either run the following command for the interactive mode where you will be asked several questions to obtain the SSL certificate.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"># Replace --nginx with --apache if you are using Apache</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> certbot</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --nginx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You will be asked to enter your email address and agree to the terms of service. You will also be asked to enter the domain name for which you want to obtain the SSL certificate. You can also specify multiple domain names if you want to secure multiple domains with a single certificate.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can run the following command to obtain the SSL certificate in a non-interactive mode where you will not be asked any questions. This is useful if you want to automate the process.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> certbot</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --apache</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> \\</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#BD93F9">  --agree-tos</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> \\</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#BD93F9">  -m</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> you@email.com</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> \\</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#BD93F9">  --no-eff-email</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> \\</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#BD93F9">  --redirect</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> \\</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#BD93F9">  --domains</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> news.roadmap.sh</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This command will obtain an SSL certificate for the specified domain name, install it for you, and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The SSL certificate is valid for three months, after which it will expire.</p>
<h2 id="auto-renewal-of-ssl-certificate">Auto-Renewal of SSL Certificate</h2>
<p>SSL certificate generated using certbot is valid for 3 months; after which you need to renew the certificate. Certbot automatically sets up the renewal for you so you don’t have to worry about.</p>
<p>For the renewal to work, you need to have a cronjob or a systemd timer set up. To check if the automatic renewal is active, you can use one of two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check cronjob to see if there is a certbot renewal cron job registered by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> crontab</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -l</span></span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t find the cron job registered, check the systemd timer by running the following command.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> systemctl</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> list-timers</span></span></code></pre>
<p>There should be a line that includes <code>certbot.timer</code>. This timer is configured to run twice daily—once in the morning and once in the evening—to automatically renew the SSL certificate near expiration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, so once you have verified that the auto-renewal timer is set up, let’s verify that the actual auto-renewal is working. Let’s do that next.</p>
<h2 id="testing-if-auto-renewal-is-working">Testing if Auto-Renewal is Working</h2>
<p>To test if the auto-renewal is working, you can run the following command provided by certbot to dry-run the renewal process.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> certbot</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> renew</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --dry-run</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This will not renew the certificate but will show you the output of the renewal process.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Try visiting your website using HTTPS and you should see a lock icon showing that the connection is secure. Also, upon visiting the HTTP version of your website, you should be redirected to the HTTPS version.</p>
<p>That’s it! You have successfully obtained and installed a Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate on your web server. You have also set up the auto-renewal so that you don’t have to worry about renewing it manually.</p>`,fl={title:"Guide to Let's Encrypt SSL Setup",description:"Learn how to protect your website using Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates.",authorId:"kamran",seo:{title:"Guide to Let's Encrypt SSL Setup - roadmap.sh",description:"Learn how to protect your website using Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates."},isNew:!1,type:"textual",date:"2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z",sitemap:{priority:.7,changefreq:"weekly"},tags:["guide","textual-guide","guide-sitemap"]},Fl="/workspace/src/data/guides/setup-and-auto-renew-ssl-certificates.md",bl=void 0;i((s,t,a)=>{const{layout:o,...e}=fl;return e.file=Fl,e.url=bl,l`${p()}${r(yl())}`});const wl=()=>`<p>When you are working on a backend application, you are likely to need a database.

<p>If you’re wondering whether Structured Query Language (SQL) is hard to learn, the honest answer is: <strong>it depends</strong>. But for most people, especially those who stick with it for a few weeks, it’s surprisingly approachable. Our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> is designed for beginner and intermediate learners, guiding you from basic queries to advanced data manipulation so you can build real-world applications.</p>
<p>At first, SQL can feel intimidating. It’s often tied to enterprise databases, backend systems, and “big data” buzzwords that make it seem out of reach. And calling it a <em>language</em> can make it sound like something you need years to master.</p>
<p>The good news is <a href="https://roadmap.sh/sql" target="_blank">SQL</a> isn’t like most programming languages. It’s declarative rather than procedural, more forgiving, and incredibly practical. Think of it like learning to drive a car instead of building one. You have a working vehicle, your database, and you just direct it to fetch exactly the data you need.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through what makes SQL feel hard at first and why it actually isn’t, once you see it in action. I’ll also share what learning SQL looks like, where people tend to get stuck, and how you can be successful.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-sql">What is SQL?</h2>
<p>SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to store, retrieve, and manage data in relational SQL databases. Before SQL came along, managing large datasets was a real challenge. But SQL changed that. Its versatility makes it easier for companies to work with massive amounts of customer records and other data.</p>
<p>You’ll use SQL to do things like pull reports, update tables, or find specific users. Here’s what that might look like in your day-to-day work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating or updating tables</li>
<li>Querying specific data</li>
<li>Adding new records</li>
<li>Deleting outdated info</li>
<li>Updating existing data</li>
<li>Controlling access to data</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find SQL in relational database management systems (RDMS) like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and Oracle. Some common use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web and mobile apps that need to store and retrieve user information</li>
<li>E-commerce platforms that track products, orders, and inventory</li>
<li>Reporting tools that analyze large volumes of business data</li>
<li>Banking systems that manage transactions and account details</li>
</ul>
<p>With SQL basics and the use cases covered, let’s take a closer look at some of the myths about learning SQL.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-people-think-sql-is-hard">What makes people think SQL is hard?</h2>
<p>SQL often seems intimidating at first, but that feeling usually comes from a few common misconceptions. Let’s explore these and address them accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s a programming language.”</strong></p>
<p>Technically, yes, it is. But when people hear “programming language,” they immediately think of languages like Python and C++ with complex syntax, loops, and step-by-step logic. It’s declarative, which means instead of telling the database how to do something step by step, you just tell it what you want and let it figure out how to get it done.</p>
<p>Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant. You don’t go into the kitchen and cook the meal yourself (like you would in Python or C++). You just say, “I’d like stir-fried rice and chicken,” and the kitchen handles the rest.</p>
<p><strong>“SQL is the database language.”</strong></p>
<p>Databases power everything from apps to websites to business tools. Since they deal with massive amounts of data, they can sound complicated. However, the core of SQL stays the same whether you’re working with ten records or ten million.</p>
<p>Even your phone’s contact list is like a simple database. When you search for “John,” it shows matching contacts. With SQL, you’re just asking questions in a structured way.</p>
<p>For example, getting a contact using JavaScript typically involves connecting to a database, defining models, writing queries, and handling responses. See the snippet below of what that can look like:</p>

<p><strong>“Only developers and data scientists use it.”</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the biggest myths when it comes to SQL. Sure, developers, database administrators, and data scientists use SQL, but so do sales analysts, support teams, product managers, marketers, and other professionals without a technical background. You don’t need to be technical to get value from it.</p>
<p>For example, a marketer could use SQL to pull open rates for an email campaign. No need for loops or advanced code; just clear and direct queries.</p>
<p><strong>“I need to memorize everything to get started.”</strong></p>
<p>Like anything new, SQL takes some getting used to. But you don’t need to memorize all the syntax to be productive. Even experienced developers and data scientists use cheat sheets all the time.</p>
<p>Think of it like Excel. When you first started, you didn’t know every formula by heart. You learned a few, looked up the rest, and got better over time.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that SQL may seem hard because of how it’s labelled and where it’s used, but at its core, it’s just a structured way to ask questions about data. Once you understand that, learning it becomes a lot less intimidating.</p>
<p>Now that the myths are out of the way, let’s explore what it is like to actually learn SQL and what makes it easier than other programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-like-to-learn-sql">What is it like to learn SQL?</h2>
<p>Learning SQL is actually more approachable than you might think. Compared to other programming languages, it has a gentle learning curve, and many of the concepts will feel familiar, especially if you’ve ever worked with a spreadsheet before. You can even try it out in your browser with <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">our interactive SQL course</a>, no installation needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaXRlaHF6N2E0MWdvYzRoa3NvMXJxMmkzZGRld3ppbXhhMm9leDNhaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/2dFhaiTuV5dYKymVi6/giphy.gif" alt="Browser-based interactive course"></p>
<p><strong>Simple and readable syntax</strong></p>
<p>Unlike other programming languages that involve conditionals, error handling, and complex logic, SQL doesn’t require memorizing a long list of commands to start doing something useful. Most SQL statements are written in plain English, and queries often read like simple sentences. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SELECT</code>: choose the data you want</li>
<li><code>FROM</code>: specify the table</li>
<li><code>WHERE</code>: filter the results</li>
<li><code>ORDER BY</code>: sort the output</li>
<li><code>JOIN</code>: combine data from multiple tables</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together, a basic query using all of these might look like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> users</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">name</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, </span><span style="color:#BD93F9">orders</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">amount</span><span style="color:#6272A4">       -- choose the data you want</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> users                             </span><span style="color:#6272A4">-- specify the main table</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">JOIN</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> orders </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">ON</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> users</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">id</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> =</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> orders</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">user_id</span><span style="color:#6272A4">  -- combine data from multiple tables</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">WHERE</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> orders</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">amount</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> ></span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 100</span><span style="color:#6272A4">              -- filter the results</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">ORDER BY</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> orders</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">.</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">amount</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> DESC</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;           </span><span style="color:#6272A4">-- sort the output</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This structure makes SQL much easier to pick up than more abstract programming languages.</p>
<p><strong>Installation and configuration</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to set up a complicated tool to start learning SQL. There are many interactive environments online where you can write and run SQL queries directly in your browser. You won’t need to install a database, configure settings, or write any setup code. Simply open a tab and start practicing.</p>
<p><strong>Similar to Excel or any other spreadsheet</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve used Excel, Google Sheets, or similar tools, you’re already familiar with the concept of tables, rows, and columns. Think about how you’d filter a spreadsheet to show specific rows or sort a list by price or alphabetically. SQL works with the same logic, but it gives you more power and flexibility to handle those tasks at scale.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example that retrieves the names of users who are 18 or older:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> name</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> users </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">WHERE</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> age </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">>=</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 18</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you read it out loud, it sounds like you’re having a conversation with the database. You’re saying, “Look in the <code>users</code> table, find everyone whose <code>age</code> is 18 or more, and give me their <code>name</code>.” There’s no boilerplate or complex syntax; just a straightforward question and a clear answer.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-sql-easier-than-other-programming-languages">What makes SQL easier than other programming languages?</h2>
<p>If you’ve tried learning a general-purpose language like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a> or <a href="https://roadmap.sh/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, you know they often come with strict syntax rules, package managers, and environment setup. That can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. SQL takes a different path:</p>
<p><strong>SQL is declarative, not procedural</strong></p>
<p>Instead of writing step-by-step instructions to get something done, you just describe what you want. The database figures out how to do it. This makes SQL easier to grasp than many other languages.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/procedural-programming-vs-sql-u8u3x.png" alt="Procedural programming vs SQL"></p>
<p>You might hear people compare Python and SQL, since both read like English. For tasks like querying data, generating reports, or filtering results, SQL is often the simpler option. You don’t need to write custom functions to sort or group data; SQL was designed to handle that. Check out our <a href="https://linear.app/hmb-roadmap/issue/HMB-56/may-sql-vs-python-which-should-you-learn-for-data-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Python vs. SQL</a> deep dive to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>No variables, loops, or boilerplate required</strong></p>
<p>In Python or JavaScript, filtering and retrieving data might involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting to a database</li>
<li>Looping through rows</li>
<li>Writing logic to filter or sort</li>
<li>Printing or exporting the output</li>
</ul>
<p>In SQL, you can usually do all that with a single line; no setup, no custom functions, no data structures to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Errors are usually clear and fixable</strong></p>
<p>SQL error messages tend to be readable, even for beginners. If you mistype a column name, you might see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ERROR: column "nmae" does not exist</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s much easier to understand than something like a Python traceback or JavaScript’s <code>undefined is not a function</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-actually-makes-sql-hard-and-how-to-get-past-it">What actually makes SQL hard (and how to get past it)?</h2>
<p>Like any other programming language, SQL has its own learning curve. The good news is that these complex sections are learnable with the right guidance. Below are some of the concepts you might find challenging at first, and how to move past them.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding JOINs and relational logic</strong></p>
<p>Most beginners struggle with JOINs. It’s common to wonder why there are different types or how to match rows between tables. But with visual examples and hands-on practice, they start to make sense. That’s why <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">our SQL course</a> includes practical examples and clear visualizations to show what’s happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/inner-join-vs-left-join-1-sgfro.png" alt="JOINs in SQL"></p>
<p><strong>Writing complex queries with subqueries or window functions</strong></p>
<p>These intermediate features let you do things like rank results, compare values across rows, or summarize data. They look intimidating at first, but they’re really just blocks you stack together. The best way to learn them is by starting small and building up.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with NULLs and data types</strong></p>
<p>NULLs represent missing or unknown values. They behave differently from regular values, which can mess with filters, calculations, and comparisons.</p>
<p>It also takes practice to understand how text, numbers, and dates work, especially when things don’t behave as expected. A tip you should always follow whenever a query isn’t returning what you think it should: always check for NULLs or mismatched data types.</p>
<p>While SQL has its tricky parts, its simplicity is also what makes it accessible for everyone. This brings us to an important question: How long does it actually take to feel confident using SQL? Let’s explore that next.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-feel-confident-with-sql">How long does it take to feel confident with SQL?</h2>
<p>SQL is one of the most beginner-friendly languages, but like anything worthwhile, it takes consistent practice to feel confident.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sql-learning-journey-xrpzm.png" alt="SQL learning journey"></p>
<p><strong>Basic proficiency: 2–3 weeks</strong></p>
<p>With just a few minutes a day, you can get comfortable writing basic SQL syntax. These commands are part of what is known as the data manipulation language (DML) and include SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and basic filtering. That’s often enough to pull reports, explore tables, and understand how data is stored and retrieved.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate skills: 1–2 months</strong></p>
<p>JOINs, <code>GROUP BY</code>, and nested queries start to make sense with repetition and context. You’ll be able to ask deeper questions, create summaries, and work across multiple tables to perform complex tasks like data analysis, data analytics, and data modeling. These are the skills that most professionals aim for.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced SQL knowledge: Continuous learning, but approachable</strong></p>
<p>Concepts like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, stored procedures, and query optimization are core SQL skills that require more time to master. They build on the fundamentals you already know and allow you to manipulate data in more advanced ways. As you grow more confident, you’ll also come across parts of SQL like Data Control Language (DCL), which helps manage access to data. These concepts aren’t required on day one, and you’ll ease into them over time with the right practice.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> walks you through each level step by step, so you don’t have to figure it out on your own. It includes practice exercises and real-world use cases, and you can go at your own pace. The key takeaway: consistency matters more than speed. Just 20 minutes of focused practice a few times a week can make a big difference.</p>

<p>With steady practice, you can start grasping basic SQL concepts in just a few days, grow confident writing queries within a month, and reach proficiency in advanced SQL concepts in three to six months.</p>
<p>However, before you mark your calendar, remember this timeline does not apply to everyone.</p>
<p>Learning a new skill or language takes time and heavily depends on your goals and learning style. The same is true for SQL. Your prior experience and the effort you dedicate are key to achieving final results.</p>
<p>Our interactive <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> is designed to guide you through every step of the journey, from SQL basics to advanced SQL. Starting with the basics like database concepts and <code>SELECT</code> queries, it steadily builds up to complex topics such as joins, subqueries, scalar, data definition language, data control language, and window functions. You’ll practice how to write SQL queries to manage data, explore datasets, and perform real-world data analysis.</p>
<p>To help you make the most of this learning path, it’s important to understand what kind of time commitment SQL requires. This guide will help you understand how long it takes to learn SQL, based on different skill levels, goals, and learning methods. It doesn’t matter if you’re a complete beginner or someone with some experience; we’ll break down clear timelines, essential topics to focus on, and practical tips to stay consistent throughout your learning journey.</p>
<h2 id="your-sql-learning-speed-depends-on-these-factors">Your SQL learning speed depends on these factors</h2>
<p>A few core factors determine how quickly you’ll get comfortable with SQL. Knowing where you stand with each one can help you set realistic expectations and tailor your learning path.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/what-affects-how-fast-you-can-learn-sql-s384i.png" alt="What affects how fast you can learn SQL?"></p>
<p><strong>Prior programming experience</strong></p>
<p>If you have some experience with programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java, you’ll likely find it easier to pick up SQL. That’s because many SQL concepts, such as logic, conditions, and data operations, feel familiar if you’ve worked with code before.</p>
<p>But don’t worry if you’re completely new to coding. You don’t need programming experience, but if you’ve worked with code, the logic will click faster. As you start working with queries, you’ll see how SQL’s structured approach aligns closely with the logical thinking used in many programming languages.</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity with databases or data concepts</strong></p>
<p>If you are someone who has used spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets before, you will pick up SQL faster. Databases store data in tables just like spreadsheets. If you’re already comfortable with basic data concepts (like creating and managing tables, rows, and columns), you can jump right into SQL syntax at the beginning of your learning journey.</p>
<p><strong>Time spent practicing each week</strong></p>
<p>Consistency matters more than cramming when learning SQL. Practicing a few times a week using a downloadable tool or an online platform helps reinforce your understanding over time. Regular practice will allow your brain to consolidate new knowledge, reinforce key concepts, and build lasting skills. Structured courses with built-in challenges and instant feedback make this process more effective by encouraging regular practice.</p>
<p><strong>Learning method</strong></p>
<p>The resources you choose for learning SQL can also make a difference. Relying only on passive reading or watching is less effective than practicing while learning. Most people, nowadays, believe YouTube tutorials and documentation are enough to learn SQL. The truth is, tutorials can help you understand concepts, but structured practice is where you’ll make the most progress.</p>
<p>You can join interactive courses for a more engaging and efficient learning experience. Videos and textbooks can also be great sources for learning concepts, but joining an interactive course for immediate feedback and practice is best.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sql-interactive-course-f1m8m.jpeg" alt="SQL interactive course"></p>
<p><strong>Goal: Basic querying vs. job-level proficiency</strong></p>
<p>What you aim to achieve is another key factor that affects how fast you can learn SQL. Let’s say your purpose for learning SQL is to be able to automate simple data reports. In this case, you won’t need to spend much time learning advanced SQL practice. However, if you aim to build a complex data model or become a data analyst, database administrator, or software engineer, you must acquire complete SQL knowledge.</p>
<p>To better understand how your skills can progress over time, the next section outlines important learning milestones, from beginner to advanced capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="a-breakdown-of-sql-learning-milestones">A breakdown of SQL learning milestones</h2>
<p>Let’s break down the SQL learning journey into practical stages. Whether you’re starting with the basics, working on subqueries and data manipulation language (DML), or exploring advanced SQL functions, this timeline provides a general guide. Your learning speed may vary depending on how much time and effort you put in.</p>
<p>If you’re still wondering about the difficulty level, check out our guide, <a href="https://linear.app/hmb-roadmap/issue/HMB-58/may-is-sql-hard-to-learn-an-expert-take" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Is SQL Hard to Learn</a>? for a deeper look at what to expect and how to overcome common challenges.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-sql-kl92v.png" alt="A breakdown of SQL learning milestones"></p>
<p><strong>Day 1 to 7: Get the basics down</strong></p>
<p>Learning SQL fundamentals and how database structures work will be the first step. Before moving to the use of basic SQL syntax, you will become familiar with the concept of relational databases, database management system, their benefits and limitations, why they’re useful, and how they differ from NoSQL systems. This foundation will help you grasp why SQL is the industry-standard language for working with structured data.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll dive into SQL statements. You’ll write your first <code>SELECT</code> queries to retrieve specific data, use <code>INSERT INTO</code> to add new records, and apply <code>WHERE</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code>, and <code>JOIN</code> clauses to filter, sort, and combine data across tables. By the end of the week, you’ll be comfortable writing simple queries to explore real datasets. If you’re following a structured learning process, this is a great time to start a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL roadmap course</a> to test your progress and reinforce what you’ve learned.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 2 to 4: Become query-confident</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve covered the basics, you’ll move on to manipulating and summarizing data. You’ll use <a href="https://satoricyber.com/glossary/dml-data-manipulation-language" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Data Manipulation Language</a> (DML) commands like <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>MERGE</code>, while also mastering more advanced clauses such as <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>HAVING</code>, and multiple types of <code>JOINs</code>.</p>
<p>You’ll write queries that combine customer and order data, summarize sales by category, or calculate total revenue by region. For example, in one of the course challenges, you’ll analyze top-performing books using <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>COUNT</code>, and <code>SUM</code>, then refine your results using <code>HAVING</code>.</p>
<p>These real challenges and practice sessions will make you feel more confident.</p>
<p><strong>Months 2 to 3: Go deeper</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you’ll start breaking down more complex problems. You’ll use subqueries to nest logic inside queries and apply <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/data/sql/using-common-table-expressions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Table Expressions</a> (CTEs) to improve readability and modularity. You’ll also work with correlated subqueries when query results depend on data from an outer query.</p>
<p>You’ll improve query performance by learning how indexes work and using tools like <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> to diagnose slow queries. You’ll also explore window functions to calculate running totals, ranks, or rolling averages, crucial for time-series data and cohort analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can explore more advanced SQL features like stored procedures, triggers, and functions to automate tasks and encapsulate logic at the database level.</p>
<p>You may find new strategies and tips to help write more efficient and faster-executing SQL queries. This phase helps you think like a data professional, making your SQL more efficient, readable, and scalable.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond 3 months: Apply and build projects</strong></p>
<p>By now, you’re ready to apply your skills. You’ll work on mini-projects like tracking personal expenses, analyzing product performance, or building a simple task manager, all using SQL as the core engine. You’ll learn how to design database schemas, define tables and relationships, and write optimized queries that handle large datasets.</p>
<p>The use of SQL and database management would be clear. This is where you transition from learning individual concepts to working on real-world projects.</p>
<p>You’ll also get to design your own database schemas, plan tables, define columns and relationships, and learn how to write SQL queries that can handle big data.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> in this stage will help you learn how to use SQL to pull the right data for charts, dashboards, and business intelligence tools like filtering sales by region, summarizing revenue trends, or preparing customer data for visualization in tools like Power BI or Tableau. You can try the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">course’s Sales Data Analysis or Book Performance exercises</a> to simulate business scenarios. These exercises will provide more extensive datasets and require you to apply a combination of SQL skills to answer business questions and other tasks.</p>
<p>These practical exercises help reinforce what you’ve learned and give you a feel for how professionals use SQL. However, how quickly you pick up these skills can vary from person to person, depending on your background and experience.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-your-background-change-the-learning-curve">How does your background change the learning curve?</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, your prior experience and professional background can impact how quickly you learn SQL. Here’s a general idea of how long it might take to learn SQL, based on your profile, whether you’re just starting out or already have some technical experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/how-does-your-background-change-the-learning-curve-0n57f.png" alt="How does your background change the learning curve?"></p>
<p><strong>Complete beginner (no coding or data background)</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to coding or learning SQL and starting from scratch, you might take some extra time to reach a higher level. First, get comfortable with basic programming logic and relational data concepts.</p>
<p>Many SQL commands may seem unfamiliar initially, but soon, you will begin to feel confident with intermediate SQL skills in a month or two. Expect a minimum of one to two months to get comfortable with data concepts and understand query logic and syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Beginner coder (some programming experience)</strong></p>
<p>Experience in programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.) can help you grasp the basics faster. The logical structure of SQL and the concept of manipulating data will be more familiar to beginner coders.</p>
<p>You can expect to learn how to write multi-table queries and basic aggregations in about three to four weeks. If you have a coding background, you may find it easier to understand how SQL fits into broader software development processes and real-world data workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Data-adjacent professionals (experience with Excel, Airtable, or BI dashboards)</strong></p>
<p>If you have worked on spreadsheets or have experience with BI tools, you might already know how to manipulate data tables. If you’re already comfortable with filtering, sorting, or basic aggregations, you will probably grasp these concepts in SQL sooner than other learners. SQL, in this case, might feel like just another step, offering more knowledge on data manipulation and advanced topics. Most individuals hardly require a month of dedicated learning and practice to excel in this field.</p>
<p>No matter which profile you belong to, remember that consistency is important. With regular practice, you can improve your skills and achieve the end goal. But before measuring progress, it’s important to understand what “learning SQL” actually means, since it can vary depending on your goals.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-learning-sql-anyway">What counts as ‘learning SQL’ anyway?</h2>
<p>Now that you know how long it takes to learn SQL, consider what you want to achieve with your SQL skills. Setting clear goals helps you stay focused and track your progress. Here are some of the common goals that people have when learning SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Running basic SQL queries</strong></p>
<p>If your goal is to generate quick insights like pulling a list of active users, filtering transactions above a certain value, or summarizing monthly sales, basic SQL commands are enough. For instance, a marketer may use <code>SELECT</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, and <code>ORDER BY</code> to audit campaign performance across different regions. Product teams often JOIN user data with event logs to identify drop-off points in the user journey.</p>
<p><strong>Writing more complex queries with subqueries or CTEs</strong></p>
<p>Need to build a churn report that tracks subscription drop-offs by cohort? Or a sales dashboard that compares revenue across product lines over time? You’ll benefit from learning subqueries, <code>GROUP BY</code> with aggregations, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). These allow you to modularize logic and pull clean, reusable datasets from raw tables.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding indexing and performance</strong></p>
<p>If you’re working with millions of rows of, say, log data from a web app or transactional records from an e-commerce platform, you’ll eventually need to write performance-optimized queries. That includes understanding indexing, choosing the right <code>JOIN</code> types, and analyzing execution plans with <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. These skills help ensure your queries run efficiently, even as data grows.</p>
<p><strong>Using SQL in data science or software engineering</strong></p>
<p>In roles like data engineering or backend development, SQL is often used alongside Python, Spark, or cloud tools to build data science pipelines or APIs. Data scientists use it to prepare datasets for modeling, like pulling engagement metrics by user segment or identifying outliers in product usage patterns.</p>
<p>Every person’s requirements are different. Some might need only basic knowledge of SQL queries to generate reports, while others may require mastering them for database optimization. So, determine your goals and practice regularly.</p>
<p>Once you’re clear on your purpose, staying motivated becomes easier. The next step is figuring out how to stay consistent and accelerate your learning process.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-stay-consistent-and-speed-up-your-learning">How to stay consistent and speed up your learning</h2>
<p>From my experience, keeping a note of these practical tips will help you learn SQL faster:</p>
<p><strong>Consistent practice:</strong> You don’t need to spend hours or a day making notes and learning SQL. All you need to do is be consistent by committing to a short, 30-minute session per day. Half an hour of daily, focused practice will add up and bring quality results.</p>
<p><strong>Build mini projects:</strong> Instead of working through exercises in isolation, apply SQL to concrete data. Create a sample database, such as a sales record or customer list, and write queries to answer real life scenario questions.</p>
<p>This practical experience of analyzing a dataset of customer orders will bring you real challenges and build confidence. Several online courses provide real datasets to improve learning and problem solving skills.</p>
<p><strong>Use SQL course challenges:</strong> Guided lessons and challenges can keep you on track. Our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a> covers dozens of practical challenges and quizzes to test your knowledge and develop problem solving skills. From ‘Book Performance’ to ‘Customer Contact List’, you can practice different queries. It also provides a course completion certificate to potential candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Pair SQL with Python:</strong> If you’re interested in data analysis or software development, learning to use SQL with other programming languages like <a href="https://roadmap.sh/python" target="_blank">Python</a> can be great. These practical experiences will motivate you and expand your capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Many beginners worry that learning SQL will take forever, but the reality is that it depends on your background, goals, and how consistently you practice. With a little dedication, you can start writing basic queries in just a week and become interview-ready in a couple of months, even without prior programming experience.</p>
<p>Just remember, some learners move faster, applying skills to data analytics or app development, while others take more time to get comfortable with queries. That’s why following a clear, step-by-step path matters. A guided course can help you avoid confusion and build confidence from day one.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sql-vs-mysql-qf2ph.png" alt="SQL vs MySQL"></p>
<h2 id="what-is-sql">What is SQL?</h2>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard data query language used to interact with relational databases, including Oracle, <a href="https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, MySQL, and SQL Server Express. Most database queries for fetching, adding, and manipulating data are based on SQL syntax.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/what-is-sql-422cl.png" alt="What is SQL?"></p>
<p>If you work as a database administrator or a developer, SQL enables you to create, read, update, and delete data also known as CRUD operations. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.</p>
<p>Given a table <code>Users</code> with four columns <code>userid,</code> <code>firstname, lastname and age</code> that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/users-table-h3t9k.png" alt="Users table"></p>
<p>You can use SQL to fetch all the users from the table using the command below:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> *</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> Users;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The code above is a simple SQL statement that gets all the data from the <code>Users</code> table. However, you can also fetch specific columns from the table instead of all the data. The code snippet below shows how to get the <code>FirstName</code> and <code>LastName</code> of each user in the <code>Users</code> table.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> FirstName, LastName </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> Users;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The result of the query looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/first-and-lastname-0vh87.png" alt="firstname and lastname columns"></p>
<h2 id="features-of-sql">Features of SQL</h2>
<p>This section will show you some of SQL’s most unique features, which include:</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/features-of-sql-uceot.png" alt="Features of SQL"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to understand</strong>: SQL uses familiar English verbs like SELECT, CREATE, and UPDATE, making its syntax intuitive, even for non-developers. Columns and tables usually have meaningful names, and you can read SQL statements as English sentences.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">CREATE</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> TABLE</span><span style="color:#50FA7B"> Users</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> (UserId </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">int</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, FirstName </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">varchar</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">(</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">255</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">), LastName </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">varchar</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">(</span><span style="color:#BD93F9">255</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">));</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the code above, even as a non-technical English speaker, you can understand what the SQL statement is doing by just reading it. It creates a table called <code>Users</code> with columns <code>UserId</code>, <code>FirstName</code>, and <code>LastName</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>High performance</strong>: SQL allows you to insert, modify, and delete data in a short amount of time. You can also use it to retrieve a large amount of data quickly and efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portability</strong>: SQL can be used across multiple RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: SQL enables the security of database systems by ensuring that only authorized users can view specific information in a database management system. For example, if you want to prevent a user from accessing a table, you can use the code below:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">REVOKE</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> SELECT</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> ON</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> Salaries </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">FROM</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> '</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">user123</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">@</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">localhost</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">;</span></span></code></pre>

<p>You can also use SQL and MySQL in small to large-scale applications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website that stores user data in MySQL database</li>
<li>An e-commerce site that stores orders, inventory, and users in a MySQL database</li>
<li>A logistics application that stores the number of deliveries made daily in a MySQL database</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-mysql-and-sql">Alternatives to MySQL and SQL</h2>
<p>Depending on your project, you may want to use a relational database management systems other than MySQL. Some other popular systems include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: A popular open source RDBMS known for its reliability, scalability, and support for open technical standards.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong>: A robust and enterprise RDBMS from Microsoft.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle database</strong>: A powerful database system used for large scale applications. You require a commercial license to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong>: A cloud-based database system managed by AWS.</li>
<li><strong>MariaDB</strong>: An open source relational database that directly replaces MySQL. It was developed by the same developers who created MySQL.</li>
<li><strong>SQLite</strong>: A lightweight, file-based database suitable for small-scale applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re exploring alternatives to SQL-based databases, you can look into NoSQL or graph databases.
Some of the common non-relational databases include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>: A document database that stores data in JSON formats. It has a flexible schema and does not use SQL for its query operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/redis" target="_blank">Redis</a>: An in-memory store that saves data in key-value pairs. It is often used for caching and real time analytics.</li>
<li><strong>Neo4j</strong>: A graph database that stores data as nodes, relationships, and properties instead of tables or documents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-database-systems">Choosing the right database systems</h2>
<p>Choosing the right database system depends on what you’re building, your team’s needs, and the data you are dealing with. The following are factors to consider when choosing the right database system for your project.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data structure and type</strong>: As a developer, you should know how your data is structured and the relationship between your entities. If you have many related entities, such as many-to-many or one-to-many relationships, you should consider relational databases, but if you have mostly one-to-one relationships, then a document database is sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Query complexity</strong>: If you have complex data and want to merge it using joins or subqueries, you should consider using relational databases. However, if you are performing simple CRUD operations on simple entities or key-based access, you should go for document databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost and licensing</strong>: This is an important factor to consider because it helps to manage your resources. It is sufficient for you to use the open-source versions of the database systems if you are working on small to medium sized applications. If you want more features and a higher level of security, then the licensed version is a better option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer familiarity</strong>: You should also consider how familiar you are with the database systems. When you know SQL, it is easier for you to work with other relational databases. Make sure you are familiar with whatever database system you decide to use</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-should-you-learn-first-sql-or-mysql">What should you learn first: SQL or MySQL?</h2>
<p>You should start with SQL because it is the foundation and once you know it, you will be able to work with any relational database management system. SQL’s syntax is approachable for English speakers, which makes it a common first step in learning database management.</p>
<p>Once you know the basics of SQL, you can move on to learning MySQL. You can transfer your knowledge of MySQL to other relational database systems like PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-next-follow-a-learning-path-that-works">What to do next: Follow a learning path that works</h2>
<p>Learning SQL and MySQL could seem overwhelming at first, but you don’t have to master everything at once. You also don’t have to choose between SQL and MySQL. You can start with SQL and learn the basic commands, and then MySQL will make sense to you when you pick it up.</p>
<p>Learning SQL prepares you to work with any relational database management system, including MySQL. You’ve already seen how SQL and MySQL work together in a real app. Now you can explore more by following the roadmap’s <a href="https://roadmap.sh/sql" target="_blank">SQL</a> track.

<h2 id="what-are-sql-and-python">What are SQL and Python?</h2>
<p>SQL is a specialized language for handling structured data in relational databases. SQL allows you to extract, modify, and delete records to generate insights that support data-driven decision-making. SQL is beginner-friendly, and you can perform database interactions and queries using understandable commands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language used to build web and desktop applications, perform data analysis, and automate tasks, among other uses. Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it a good language to learn when starting your programming journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sql-vs-python-5jnjh.png" alt="SQL vs. Python"></p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-sql">Key features of SQL</h2>
<p>Some key features of SQL include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Declarative language:</strong> SQL uses a declarative programming approach where you describe what you want to achieve rather than explicitly defining how to achieve it. For example, the SQL statement <code>SELECT * FROM Users</code> means “fetch all the users from a database table.” The database engine then performs its magic behind the scenes to execute the command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy syntax:</strong> SQL is straightforward to learn and understand, even if you have no prior programming knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Almost all Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, adopt SQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: You can use SQL to add new tables, edit tables, and delete old tables. This means you can use it to scale up or down to accommodate datasets according to business needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wide range of commands</strong>: SQL supports different types of commands. These commands can be divided into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Query Language (DQL)</strong>: The primary focus of DQL is to retrieve data without modifying it. The primary command here is <code>SELECT</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong>: You use these commands to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, indexes, and so on. The key commands here are <code>CREATE</code>, <code>ALTER</code>, and <code>DROP</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong>: You use these commands to control access to data in a database by granting or revoking user permissions. Examples include <code>GRANT</code>, and  <code>REVOKE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong>: This is a subset of SQL you use to insert, update, and delete data from database tables. Examples include <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>UPDATE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transaction Control Language (TCL)</strong>: You use these commands to manage transactions in a database. They help ensure the data is secure and consistent. Examples include <code>COMMIT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get to practice using all these command types hands-on in our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a>. Each lesson focuses on practical query writing and real use cases, which helps you understand when and how to apply what you learn.</p>

<h2 id="key-features-of-python">Key features of Python</h2>
<p>Here are some of the key features of Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to read and understand</strong>: Python syntax is clean and readable. Instead of curly braces, it uses indentation for code blocks, making it easier to scan and debug.</p>

<h2 id="how-sql-and-python-work-together-in-data-projects">How SQL and Python work together in data projects</h2>
<p>You use SQL for data management, i.e., retrieving, filtering, organizing, and inserting data. On the other hand, you use Python for more general programming applications, such as data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and automation.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a practical scenario demonstrating how to use both for data analysis. Suppose you’re assigned a project to analyze the sales data of an e-commerce company and develop a sales forecast. Here’s how you might approach it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong>: This involves gathering all relevant data from the client, which may be in different locations and formats. Your goal is to consolidate the data into a unified structure for analysis. If the data is in the client’s database, you can use SQL to extract and migrate it to a destination database. If the data is accessible via an API, you can use Python to fetch it and store it in your database for further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data cleaning:</strong> Before analysis, you should make sure the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. This step involves identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and resolving inconsistencies. You can use SQL basic cleaning tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing rows with missing data</li>
<li>Dropping unwanted columns</li>
<li>Setting default values</li>
<li>Filtering and grouping data based on specific criteria</li>
<li>Combining data from multiple tables</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Python is more suitable for complex cleaning operations, such as handling nested structures, working with unstructured data, and data transformation. NumPy and Pandas are popular Python libraries that provide powerful tools and functions for advanced data cleaning and manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data manipulation:</strong> Once the data is cleaned, the next step is to organize it in a way that makes it easier to analyze and interpret. Use Python to analyze and manipulate data. Python’s Numpy and Pandas libraries offer robust tools for reshaping, filtering, and aggregating your cleaned data as well as restructuring data, making it ready for visualization and further analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data visualization</strong>: For basic visualizations, you can use some data analytics tools based on SQL. However, Python is more commonly used for creating detailed and customizable visualizations. Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are widely used in the data science community and support 2D and 3D plots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making predictions</strong>: After cleaning and exploring the data, you can use it to build predictive models. This stage is typically handled entirely in Python, as SQL is not designed for machine learning. Python offers extensive libraries, like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, which provide a wide range of regression, classification, and clustering algorithms. By training and evaluating models using these tools, you can generate accurate sales forecasts based on the data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="should-you-learn-sql-or-python-first">Should you learn SQL or Python first?</h2>
<p>Start with SQL if your primary goal is to work with databases, and learn Python next to expand what you can do with that data. I began my career by learning SQL first, and it turned out to be the right decision. It helped me understand how data is stored, structured, and queried, which made it much easier to learn Python later. Once I had the data in hand, Python gave me the flexibility to clean, analyze, and build models on top of it. Learning SQL first gave me a strong foundation that I still rely on today.</p>
<p>If you’re just getting started, check out our <a href="https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql" target="_blank">SQL course</a>. The course offers interactive query writing with instant feedback, which helps solidify your understanding.</p>
<p>However, deciding which language to learn first depends on your goals and interests. But if you want to succeed in the data field, mastering both SQL and Python is important. They complement each other and make you a more effective data professional.</p>
<h2 id="is-sql-a-dying-language">Is SQL a dying language?</h2>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/svc7ju/is_sql_still_has_viable_as_it_was_several_years/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing debate</a> about whether SQL is becoming obsolete and if it’s still worth learning. My answer is no. SQL is not dying. In fact, it remains one of the most widely used languages in data analysis and management.</p>
<p>While technologies like NoSQL databases and other document and graph-based databases have gained popularity, they haven’t replaced SQL. Instead, SQL has continued to evolve and adapt to modern data needs, including large-scale data processing. As long as organizations store data in relational databases, SQL will remain a valuable skill in the data professional’s toolkit.</p>
<h2 id="sql-vs-python-key-differences-that-trip-people-up">SQL vs. Python: Key differences that trip people up</h2>
<p>Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, it’s normal to get confused when switching between SQL and Python. You may wonder when to use each one, where they overlap, and what sets them apart.</p>
<p>To help clear things up, here are some of the key differences between SQL and Python:</p>

In contrast with the traditional client/server relationship, in which downloaders connect to a central server (for example: watching a movie on Netflix, or loading the web page you’re reading now), participants in the BitTorrent network, called <strong>peers</strong>, download pieces of files from <em>each other</em>—this is what makes it a <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> protocol. In this article we will investigate how this works, and build our own client that can find peers and exchange data between them.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/client-server-p2p.png" alt="diagram showing the difference between client/server (all clients connecting to one server) and peer-to-peer (peers connecting to each other) relationships"></p>
<p>The protocol evolved organically over the past 20 years, and various people and organizations added extensions for features like encryption, private torrents, and new ways of finding peers. We’ll be implementing the <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">original spec</a> from 2001 to keep this a weekend-sized project.</p>
<p>I’ll be using a <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/#indexlist" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Debian ISO</a> file as my guinea pig because it’s big, but not huge, at 350MB. As a popular Linux distribution, there will be lots of fast and cooperative peers for us to connect to. And we’ll avoid the legal and ethical issues related to downloading pirated content.</p>
<h2 id="finding-peers">Finding peers</h2>
<p>Here’s a problem: we want to download a file with BitTorrent, but it’s a peer-to-peer protocol and we have no idea where to find peers to download it from. This is a lot like moving to a new city and trying to make friends—maybe we’ll hit up a local pub or a meetup group! Centralized locations like these are the big idea behind trackers, which are central servers that introduce peers to each other. They’re just web servers running over HTTP, and you can find Debian’s at <code>http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/trackers.png" alt="illustration of a desktop computer and laptop sitting at a pub"></p>
<p>Of course, these central servers are liable to get raided by the feds if they facilitate peers exchanging illegal content. You may remember reading about trackers like TorrentSpy, Popcorn Time, and Kickass Torrents getting seized and shut down. New methods cut out the middleman by making even <strong>peer discovery</strong> a distributed process. We won’t be implementing them, but if you’re interested, some terms you can research are <strong>DHT</strong>, <strong>PEX</strong>, and <strong>magnet links</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-a-torrent-file">Parsing a .torrent file</h3>
<p>A .torrent file describes the contents of a torrentable file and information for connecting to a tracker. It’s all we need in order to kickstart the process of downloading a torrent. Debian’s .torrent file looks like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">d8:announce41:http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/announce7:comment35:"Debian CD from cdimage.debian.org"13:creation datei1573903810e9:httpseedsl145:https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/10.2.0//srv/cdbuilder.debian.org/dst/deb-cd/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso145:https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/10.2.0//srv/cdbuilder.debian.org/dst/deb-cd/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.isoe4:infod6:lengthi351272960e4:name31:debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso12:piece lengthi262144e6:pieces26800:�����PS�^�� (binary blob of the hashes of each piece)ee</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That mess is encoded in a format called <strong>Bencode</strong> (pronounced <em>bee-encode</em>), and we’ll need to decode it.</p>
<p>Bencode can encode roughly the same types of structures as JSON—strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. Bencoded data is not as human-readable/writable as JSON, but it can efficiently handle binary data and it’s really simple to parse from a stream. Strings come with a length prefix, and look like <code>4:spam</code>. Integers go between <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> markers, so <code>7</code> would encode to <code>i7e</code>. Lists and dictionaries work in a similar way: <code>l4:spami7ee</code> represents <code>['spam', 7]</code>, while <code>d4:spami7ee</code> means <code>{spam: 7}</code>.</p>
<p>In a prettier format, our .torrent file looks like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">d</span></span>

<p>In this file, we can spot the URL of the tracker, the creation date (as a Unix timestamp), the name and size of the file, and a big binary blob containing the SHA-1 hashes of each <strong>piece</strong>, which are equally-sized parts of the file we want to download. The exact size of a piece varies between torrents, but they are usually somewhere between 256KB and 1MB. This means that a large file might be made up of <em>thousands</em> of pieces. We’ll download these pieces from our peers, check them against the hashes from our torrent file, assemble them together, and boom, we’ve got a file!</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/pieces.png" alt="&#x22;illustration of a file being cut with scissors into multiple pieces, starting with piece 0"></p>
<p>This mechanism allows us to verify the integrity of each piece as we go. It makes BitTorrent resistant to accidental corruption or intentional <strong>torrent poisoning</strong>. Unless an attacker is capable of breaking SHA-1 with a preimage attack, we will get exactly the content we asked for.</p>
<p>It would be really fun to write a bencode parser, but parsing isn’t our focus today.

<p>Because I like to keep my structures relatively flat, and I like to keep my application structs separate from my serialization structs, I exported a different, flatter struct named <code>TorrentFile</code> and wrote a few helper functions to convert between the two.</p>
<p>Notably, I split <code>pieces</code> (previously a string) into a slice of hashes (each <code>[20]byte</code>) so that I can easily access individual hashes later. I also computed the SHA-1 hash of the entire bencoded <code>info</code> dict (the one which contained the name, size, and piece hashes). We know this as the <strong>infohash</strong> and it uniquely identifies files when we talk to trackers and peers. More on this later.</p>

<p>Now that we have information about the file and its tracker, let’s talk to the tracker to <strong>announce</strong> our presence as a peer and to retrieve a list of other peers. We just need to make a GET request to the <code>announce</code> URL supplied in the .torrent file, with a few query parameters:</p>

<p>The important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>info_hash</strong>: Identifies the <em>file</em> we’re trying to download. It’s the infohash we calculated earlier from the bencoded <code>info</code> dict. The tracker will use this to figure out which peers to show us.</li>
<li><strong>peer_id</strong>: A 20 byte name to identify <em>ourselves</em> to trackers and peers. We’ll just generate 20 random bytes for this. Real BitTorrent clients have IDs like <code>-TR2940-k8hj0wgej6ch</code> which identify the client software and version—in this case, TR2940 stands for Transmission client 2.94.</li>

<p><code>Interval</code> tells us how often we’re supposed to connect to the tracker again to refresh our list of peers. A value of 900 means we should reconnect every 15 minutes (900 seconds).</p>
<p><code>Peers</code> is another long binary blob containing the IP addresses of each peer. It’s made out of <strong>groups of six bytes</strong>. The first four bytes in each group represent the peer’s IP address—each byte represents a number in the IP. The last two bytes represent the port, as a big-endian <code>uint16</code>. <strong>Big-endian</strong>, or <strong>network order</strong>, means that we can interpret a group of bytes as an integer by just squishing them together left to right. For example, the bytes <code>0x1A</code>, <code>0xE1</code> make <code>0x1AE1</code>, or 6881 in decimal.</p>

<p>I set a timeout so that I don’t waste too much time on peers that aren’t going to let me connect. For the most part, it’s a pretty standard TCP connection.</p>
<h3 id="complete-the-handshake">Complete the handshake</h3>
<p>We’ve just set up a connection with a peer, but we want to do a handshake to validate our assumptions that the peer</p>
<ul>
<li>can communicate using the BitTorrent protocol</li>
<li>is able to understand and respond to our messages</li>
<li>has the file that we want, or at least knows what we’re talking about</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/handshake.png" alt="Two computers communicating. One asks &#x27;do you speak BitTorrent and have this file?&#x27; and the other replies &#x27;I speak BitTorrent and have that file&#x27;"></p>
<p>My father told me that the secret to a good handshake is a firm grip and eye contact. The secret to a good BitTorrent handshake is that it’s made up of five parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The length of the protocol identifier, which is always 19 (0x13 in hex)</li>
<li>The protocol identifier, called the <strong>pstr</strong> which is always <code>BitTorrent protocol</code></li>
<li>Eight <strong>reserved bytes</strong>, all set to 0. We’d flip some of them to 1 to indicate that we support certain <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extensions</a>. But we don’t, so we’ll keep them at 0.</li>
<li>The <strong>infohash</strong> that we calculated earlier to identify which file we want</li>
<li>The <strong>Peer ID</strong> that we made up to identify ourselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Put together, a handshake string might look like this:</p>

<p>After we send a handshake to our peer, we should receive a handshake back in the same format. The infohash we get back should match the one we sent so that we know that we’re talking about the same file. If everything goes as planned, we’re good to go. If not, we can sever the connection because there’s something wrong. <em>“Hello?” “这是谁？ 你想要什么？” “Okay, wow, wrong number.”</em></p>
<p>In our code, let’s make a struct to represent a handshake, and write a few methods for serializing and reading them:</p>

<h3 id="send-and-receive-messages">Send and receive messages</h3>
<p>Once we’ve completed the initial handshake, we can send and receive <strong>messages</strong>. Well, not quite—if the other peer isn’t ready to accept messages, we can’t send any until they tell us they’re ready. In this state, we’re considered <strong>choked</strong> by the other peer. They’ll send us an <strong>unchoke</strong> message to let us know that we can begin asking them for data. By default, we assume that we’re choked until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Once we’ve been unchoked, we can then begin sending <strong>requests</strong> for pieces, and they can send us messages back containing pieces.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/choke.png" alt="&#x22;A cartoon in which person 1 says &#x27;hello I would like piece number—&#x27; and person 2 grabs him by the neck and says &#x27;00 00 00 01 00 (choke)&#x27;"></p>
<h4 id="interpreting-messages">Interpreting messages</h4>
<p>A message has a length, an <strong>ID</strong> and a <strong>payload</strong>. On the wire, it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/message.png" alt="A message with 4 byte for the length, 1 byte for ID, and an optional payload"></p>
<p>A message starts with a length indicator which tells us how many bytes long the message will be. It’s a 32-bit integer, meaning it’s made out of four bytes smooshed together in big-endian order. The next byte, the <strong>ID</strong>, tells us which type of message we’re receiving—for example, a <code>2</code> byte means “interested.” Finally, the optional <strong>payload</strong> fills out the remaining length of the message.</p>

<h4 id="bitfields">Bitfields</h4>
<p>One of the most interesting types of message is the <strong>bitfield</strong>, which is a data structure that peers use to efficiently encode which pieces they are able to send us. A bitfield looks like a byte array, and to check which pieces they have, we just need to look at the positions of the <em>bits</em> set to 1. You can think of it like the digital equivalent of a coffee shop loyalty card. We start with a blank card of all <code>0</code>, and flip bits to <code>1</code> to mark their positions as “stamped.”</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/bitfield.png" alt="a coffee shop loyalty card with eight slots, with stamps on the first four slots and a stamp on the second to last slot, represented as 11110010"></p>
<p>By working with <em>bits</em> instead of <em>bytes</em>, this data structure is super compact. We can stuff information about eight pieces in the space of a single byte—the size of a <code>bool</code>. The tradeoff is that accessing values becomes a little more tricky. The smallest unit of memory that computers can address are bytes, so to get to our bits, we have to do some bitwise manipulation:</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>We now have all the tools we need to download a torrent: we have a list of peers obtained from the tracker, and we can communicate with them by dialing a TCP connection, initiating a handshake, and sending and receiving messages. Our last big problems are handling the <strong>concurrency</strong> involved in talking to multiple peers at once, and managing the <strong>state</strong> of our peers as we interact with them. These are both classically Hard problems.</p>
<h4 id="managing-concurrency-channels-as-queues">Managing concurrency: channels as queues</h4>
<p>In Go, we <a href="https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">share memory by communicating</a>, and we can think of a Go channel as a cheap thread-safe queue.</p>
<p>We’ll set up two channels to synchronize our concurrent workers: one for dishing out work (pieces to download) between peers, and another for collecting downloaded pieces. As downloaded pieces come in through the results channel, we can copy them into a buffer to start assembling our complete file.</p>

<p>We’ll keep track of each peer in a struct, and modify that struct as we read messages. It’ll include data like how much we’ve downloaded from the peer, how much we’ve requested from them, and whether we’re choked. If we wanted to scale this further, we could formalize this as a finite state machine. But a struct and a switch are good enough for now.</p>

<h4 id="time-to-make-requests">Time to make requests!</h4>
<p>Files, pieces, and piece hashes aren’t the full story—we can go further by breaking down pieces into <strong>blocks</strong>. A block is a part of a piece, and we can fully define a block by the <strong>index</strong> of the piece it’s part of, its byte <strong>offset</strong> within the piece, and its <strong>length</strong>. When we make requests for data from peers, we are actually requesting <em>blocks</em>. A block is usually 16KB large, meaning that a single 256 KB piece might actually require 16 requests.</p>
<p>A peer is supposed to sever the connection if they receive a request for a block larger than 16KB. However, based on my experience, they’re often perfectly happy to satisfy requests up to 128KB. I only got moderate gains in overall speed with larger block sizes, so it’s probably better to stick with the spec.</p>
<h4 id="pipelining">Pipelining</h4>
<p>Network round-trips are expensive, and requesting each block one by one will absolutely thank the performance of our download. Therefore, it’s important to <strong>pipeline</strong> our requests such that we keep up a constant pressure of some number of unfulfilled requests. This can increase the throughput of our connection by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p><img src="/guides/torrent-client/pipelining.png" alt="Two email threads simulating peer connections. The thread on the left shows a request followed by a reply, repeated three times. The thread on the left sends three requests, and receives three replies in quick succession."></p>
<p>Classically, BitTorrent clients kept a queue of five pipelined requests, and that’s the value I’ll be using. I found that increasing it can up to double the speed of a download. Newer clients use an <a href="https://luminarys.com/posts/writing-a-bittorrent-client.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adaptive</a> queue size to better accommodate modern network speeds and conditions. This is definitely a parameter worth tweaking, and it’s pretty low hanging fruit for future performance optimization.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-internet">What is the Internet?</h2>
<p>The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.</p>
<p>In the video below, Vint Cerf, one of the “fathers of the internet,” explains the history of how the Internet works and how no one person or organization is really in charge of it.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dxcc6ycZ73M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="wires-cables-and-wi-fi">Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>Information on the Internet moves from one computer to another in the form of bits over various mediums, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (i.e., radio waves).</p>
<p>In the video linked below, you will learn about the different mediums for data transfer on the Internet and the pros and cons for each.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhEf7e4kopM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="ip-addresses-and-dns">IP Addresses and DNS</h2>
<p>Now that you know about the physical medium for the data transfer over the internet, it’s time to learn about the protocols involved. How does the information traverse from one computer to another in this massive global network of computers?</p>
<p>In the video below, you will get a brief introduction to IP, DNS, and how these protocols make the Internet work.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o8CwafCxnU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="packets-routing-and-reliability">Packets, Routing, and Reliability</h2>
<p>Information transfer on the Internet from one computer to another does not need to follow a fixed path; in fact, it may change paths during the transfer. This information transfer is done in the form of packets and these packets may follow different routes depending on certain factors.</p>
<p>In this video, you will learn about how the packets of information are routed from one computer to another to reach the destination.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYdF7b3nMto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="http-and-html">HTTP and HTML</h2>
<p>HTTP is the standard protocol by which webpages are transferred over the Internet. The video below is a brief introduction to HTTP and how web browsers load websites for you.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBXQZMmiA4s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="encryption-and-public-keys">Encryption and Public Keys</h2>
<p>Cryptography is what keeps our communication secure on the Internet. In this short video, you will learn the basics of cryptography, SSL/TLS, and how they help make the communication on the Internet secure.</p>
<iframe class="w-full aspect-video mb-5" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZghMPWGXexs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="cybersecurity-and-crime">Cybersecurity and Crime</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity refers to the protective measures against criminal activity accomplished through using a network, technological devices, and the internet. In this video, you will learn about the basics of cybersecurity and common cybercrimes.</p>

Stories of people building a startup or project and seemingly stumbling upon a goldmine aren’t few, but they aren’t the rule. These stories are still the exception in the mass of launched projects and startups.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wright brothers</a> built their Kitty Hawk, people generally believed heavy objects could not fly - physics simply forbade it. The idea of regularly boarding airplanes as we do it these days was unthinkable. It was considered an unrealistic daydream for humans to ever claim the sky. When the first airplanes took off, people were fascinated, of course. It was a topic people continued to talk about for ages. Technology had made something impossible possible. While the wording “build it and they will come” originated from the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Field of Dreams</a>, this and similar historic events gave birth to the idea behind it.</p>
<p>The engineers’ and inventors’ dreams came true: spend time doing what you love while success follows magically. The internet and web-standards democratized access to this dream. But with it, the idea behind it faded and became less and less powerful. In 2020, there are very strong signs the popular saying isn’t correct anymore.</p>
<h2 id="why-doesnt-build-it-and-they-will-come-work-anymore">Why doesn’t “build it and they will come” work anymore?</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons for working hard to make “build it and they will come” a thing of the past. This being said, it doesn’t mean you can’t succeed in building a side-project anymore. You’ve just got to adjust the way you are building it.</p>
<h3 id="building-got-much-easier">Building got much easier</h3>
<p>As a software engineer, some websites are a blessing. Most of us couldn’t work without GitHub, Stackoverflow and of course Google, ahem, DuckDuckGo. These powerful sites help us to solve problems, learn new techniques and find the right libraries to make building projects easier. If any of these sites are down, most engineers take a break and go for a coffee instead of trying to continue working. Combine this with more sophisticated web-standards and easier access to tooling, and you arrive at a world where building projects isn’t just a job for highly specialist developers anymore. Powerful frameworks such as <a href="https://laravel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel</a> and <a href="https://quasar.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quasar Framework</a> are available for anyone to build projects on - for free.</p>
<p>In fact, building projects got to a point where some people simply build them as an exercise or hobby. If you spend some time browsing GitHub you will be surprised by the open source projects people built without any commercial goals. “Low code” and “No code” are the next wave of people building projects with a less technological background.</p>
<h3 id="too-much-going-on-information-overload">Too much going on: information overload</h3>
<p>We are living in a world with information overload. In the online sphere, you can find a lot of useful information. But there is also a lot of noise. For each piece of information or advice, you can find a number of opposing statements. This is partly due to the fact that the internet made it much easier to publish and share information. Everyone has been given a voice - for good or bad. This makes it much harder to reach potential users. Your new project probably just drowns amongst kitten videos, opinions, and news. Never has the average lifetime of published content been so low. You’ve got to come up with a marketing plan before setting out on the journey.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-problems">Smaller Problems</h3>
<p>Besides building is easier than ever before and attention is in short supply, there is another issue making the life of makers, inventors, and engineers harder: today’s problems are much smaller. Back when the previously mentioned Wright Brothers set out, they fascinated people with the problem they were aiming to address: flying. Unless your name is Elon, your problem is unlikely to attract many people naturally. As a solo developer or indie hacker, the chances are higher of having a much smaller problem in a niche (of a niche). With the information overload mentioned before, niches are pretty much the only way to build a side-project or startup and succeed.</p>
<p>Does sound pretty grim for inventors, developers, and engineers? Well, yes and no. We’ve got to tweak the approach to get in front of the eye of potential users and customers.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-market-your-project-nowadays">How to market your project nowadays?</h2>
<p>The very first step to improving the odds of success is <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">idea validation</a>. While this sounds fairly obvious, many engineers and developers still don’t validate their ideas before starting to build the MVP. The result is another stale project and wasted effort. To succeed you need to work on marketing before you start building anything. In the link mentioned before, I describe my approach to validation and collecting useful marketing information at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="build-your-audience-first-and-the-project-after">Build your Audience first and the project after.</h3>
<p>Build your audience before you build your project. Spend your time connecting with potential users, learning from their needs, and talking about their problems. This will help you market your project later on. The audience first, projects second. There are numerous ways to build an audience. One of the simplest and easiest is to start with a personal or <a href="https://startupnamecheck.com/blog/how-to-start-a-small-business-blog" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">project blog</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t use Medium or a similar service - opt for a self-hosted blog as it allows you to build the blog freely to your needs and have decent links back to your project later on. Don’t forget to add a newsletter. Newsletters are a key to reconnecting in our world of short attention spans.</p>
<h3 id="tool-by-tool">Tool by Tool</h3>
<p>Another approach is the “Tool by Tool” approach. I first noticed this approach being used by Shopify. The team at Shopify is providing little tools such as a <a href="https://hatchful.shopify.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">logo generator</a> and releasing these tools free for anyone to use. This not just builds goodwill with people; it also allows Shopify to attract powerful backlinks to their projects. As developers, we are in the perfect position to build such mini-tools. It boosts morale and drives attention at the same time.</p>
<p>Spend some time evaluating where your project or product will deliver value to the end-user. Look at options to split off small, independent tools. Build these and launch them before launching the whole product. This allows you to practice launching and promoting your part-projects at the same time. With each backlink to your part-projects, you will enhance your ranking in Google. An example of a maker following this approach is <a href="https://kambanthemaker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kamban</a> with <a href="https://flatga.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FlatGA</a>. He built FlatGA as phase one of a bigger project currently in development.</p>
<h3 id="join-a-maker-community">Join a Maker community</h3>
<p>While you are building your part-projects, don’t forget to discuss the progress publicly. This helps to attract an audience around your work and makes the launches easier. You can use Twitter threads and Reddit posts to share updates. A maker community such as <a href="https://getmakerlog.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">makerlog</a> or <a href="https://wip.chat" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WIP.chat</a> can also extend your reach. These allow you to get instant feedback, and keep yourself accountable and they will enhance your reach at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="getting-ready-to-launch">Getting ready to Launch</h3>
<p>Launching seems like this special moment when you release your project into the wide world. Often this moment is combined with high expectations and developers consider launching their project the key - if not only - part of their approach to marketing. While launching can help to attract some initial customers, it shouldn’t be your only idea when it comes to marketing. You should also know that launching isn’t a single event. You can (and should) launch again and again. Every time you launch you are increasing the chance to reach more new customers. After the launch is before the launch.</p>
<h3 id="marketing-is-an-on-going-fight">Marketing Is an On-going Fight</h3>
<p>Many developers plan to launch their product on a few sites and see where it takes their project from there on. This works well if your product goes viral by luck. A much more sustainable approach is constantly working a little on it. Marketing is most effective if done consistently. That holds true for blogging as well as most other forms of marketing. A simple approach to keep you on the path to marketing your project regularly is subscribing to a free <a href="https://wheretopost.email" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter with small marketing opportunities</a>. This way, you are regularly reminded and given bite-sized tasks to complete.</p>
