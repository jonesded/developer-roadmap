The form will include fields for a full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text. Additionally, the form will feature a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness. While this version of the form won’t be functional, it will be a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to not only help you practice your HTML and CSS but also to focus on creating an accessible form that is easy to use for all users, including those with disabilities. Given below is the rough mockup of the form UI that you need to create:</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-guidelines">Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<p>You should read up on accessibility guidelines and best practices before starting this project. However, here are some key points to keep in mind while creating an accessible form UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Ensure that each form field has a corresponding <code>&#x3C;label></code> element that is clearly associated with the field using the <code>for</code> attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Focus State</strong>: Style the focus state of each input field so that users navigating with a keyboard can easily see which field is currently active.</li>
<li><strong>Error Messaging</strong>: Consider adding space for error messages that can be displayed when a user inputs invalid data. These messages should be clearly associated with the relevant input field.</li>
<li><strong>ARIA Attributes</strong>: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary, such as <code>aria-required</code> for required fields and <code>aria-invalid</code> for fields with errors.</li>
<li><strong>Color Contrast</strong>: Ensure that the color contrast between text and background is sufficient to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, making the form readable for users with visual impairments.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Elements</strong>: Make sure that the button to show/hide the password is accessible via keyboard and screen readers, providing clear feedback on the current state (e.g., “Password is hidden” or “Password is visible”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, you can test the form UI using a screen reader or browser extensions like Axe or Lighthouse to check for accessibility issues and make necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>After completing this project, you will have a solid foundation in creating accessible and well-structured forms using HTML and CSS.

<p>You don’t have to implement pagination, authentication or authorization for this project. You can focus on the core functionality of the API.</p>
<p>While retrieving posts, user can also filter posts by a search term. You should do a wildcard search on the title, content or category fields of the blog posts. For example:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>GET /posts?term=tech</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This should return all blog posts that have the term “tech” in their title, content or category. You can use a simple SQL query if you are using a SQL database or a similar query for a NoSQL database.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to help you understand how to work with websockets and implement real-time communication between clients and servers. This will help you understand how the real-time features of applications like chat applications, live scoreboards, etc., work.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>You are required to build a CLI based application that can be used to either start the server or connect to the server as a client. Here are the sample commands that you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>broadcast-server start</code> - This command will start the server.</li>
<li><code>broadcast-server connect</code> - This command will connect the client to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the server is started using the <code>broadcast-server start</code> command, it should listen for client connections on a specified port (you can configure that using command options or hardcode for simplicity). When a client connects and sends a message, the server should broadcast this message to all connected clients.</p>
<p>The server should be able to handle multiple clients connecting and disconnecting gracefully.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>You can use any programming language to implement this project. Here are some of the steps that you can follow to implement this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a server that listens for incoming connections.</li>
<li>When a client connects, store the connection in a list of connected clients.</li>
<li>When a client sends a message, broadcast this message to all connected clients.</li>
<li>Handle client disconnections and remove the client from the list of connected clients.</li>
<li>Implement a client that can connect to the server and send messages.</li>
<li>Test the server by connecting multiple clients and sending messages.</li>
<li>Implement error handling and graceful shutdown of the server.</li>

<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="shell"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">caching-proxy</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --port</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 3000</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --origin</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> http://dummyjson.com</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The caching proxy server should start on port 3000 and forward requests to <code>http://dummyjson.com</code>.</p>
<p>Taking the above example, if the user makes a request to <code>http://localhost:3000/products</code>, the caching proxy server should forward the request to <code>http://dummyjson.com/products</code>, return the response along with headers and cache the response. Also, add the headers to the response that indicate whether the response is from the cache or the server.</p>

<span class="line"><span>X-Cache: MISS</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If the same request is made again, the caching proxy server should return the cached response instead of forwarding the request to the server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use any programming language for any available module for parsing command arguments (e.g. python with the <code>argparse</code>, node.js with <code>commander</code> etc).</li>
<li>Use a simple text file to store the expenses data. You can use JSON, CSV, or any other format to store the data.</li>
<li>Add error handling to handle invalid inputs and edge cases (e.g. negative amounts, non-existent expense IDs, etc).</li>
<li>Use functions to modularize the code and make it easier to test and maintain.</li>

The system will feature JWT authentication, CRUD operations for workouts, and generate reports on past workouts.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>You are required to develop an API for a workout tracker application that allows users to manage their workouts and track their progress. Your first task is to think about the database schema and the API endpoints that will be needed to support the application’s functionality. Here are some of the key features you should consider:</p>
<h3 id="exercise-data">Exercise Data</h3>
<p>You should write a data seeder to populate the database with a list of exercises. Each exercise should have a name, description, and category (e.g., cardio, strength, flexibility) or muscle group (e.g., chest, back, legs). Exercises will be used to create workout plans.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication-and-authorization">User Authentication and Authorization</h3>
<p>Users will be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application. You should use JWTs for authentication and authorization. Only authenticated users should be able to create, update, and delete workout plans. Needless to say, users should only be able to access their own workout plans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign-Up</strong>: Allow users to create an account.</li>
<li><strong>Login</strong>: Allow users to log in to their account.</li>
<li><strong>JWT</strong>: Use JSON Web Tokens for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workout-management">Workout Management</h3>
<p>Users will be able to create their workout plans. Workout plans should consist of multiple exercises, each with a set number of repetitions, sets, and weights. Users should be able to update and delete their workout plans. Additionally, users should be able to schedule workouts for specific dates and times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Workout: Allow users to create workouts composed of multiple exercises.</li>
<li>Update Workout: Allow users to update workouts and add comments.</li>
<li>Delete Workout: Allow users to delete workouts.</li>
<li>Schedule Workouts: Allow users to schedule workouts for specific dates and times.</li>
<li>List Workouts: List active or pending workouts sorted by date and time.</li>
<li>Generate Reports: Generate reports on past workouts and progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>You are free to choose the programming language and database of your choice. Actual decisions for the database schema, API endpoints, and other implementation details are up to you. However, you should consider the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database</strong>: Use a relational database to store user data, workout plans, and exercise data.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>: Develop a RESTful API to interact with the database.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Implement JWT authentication to secure the API endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Learn about OpenAPI Specs. Document your API endpoints and provide examples of how to use them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-implement">How to Implement</h2>
<p>Here are some guidelines to help you implement the personal blog:</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>To keep things simple for now, you can use the filesystem to store the articles. Each article will be stored as a separate file in a directory. The file will contain the title, content, and date of publication of the article. You can use JSON or Markdown format to store the articles.</p>
<h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>
<p>You can use any programming language to build the backend of the blog. You don’t have to make it as an API for this project, we have other projects for that. You can have pages that render the HTML directly from the server and forms that submit data to the server.</p>
<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
<p>For the frontend, you can use HTML and CSS (no need for JavaScript for now). You can use any templating engine to render the articles on the frontend.</p>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>You can implement basic authentication for the admin section. You can either use the <a href="https://youtu.be/mwccHwUn7Gc?t=20" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">standard HTTP basic authentication</a> or simply hardcode the username and password in the code for now and create a simple login page that will create a session for the admin.</p>
<hr>
<p>After completing this project, you will have practised templating, filesystem operations, basic authentication, form handling, and rendering HTML pages from the server. You can extend this project further by adding features like comments, categories, tags, search functionality, etc. Make sure to check the other backend projects that go into more advanced topics like databases, APIs, security best practices etc.</p>`,En={title:"Personal Blog",description:"Build a personal blog to write and publish articles on various topics.",isNew:!1,sort:600,difficulty:"beginner",nature:"Web App",skills:["Programming Language","Basic Authentication","Markdown","Filesystem","Libraries"],seo:{title:"Personal Blog Project Idea",description:"Build a personal blog to write and publish articles on various topics.

The platform will handle various aspects of an online store, such as product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart, payment processing, and order management. Each of these features will be implemented as separate microservices, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.</p>
<h2 id="core-microservices">Core Microservices:</h2>
<p>Here are the sample core microservices that you can implement for your e-commerce platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Service:</strong> Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.</li>
<li><strong>Product Catalog Service:</strong> Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping Cart Service:</strong> Manages users’ shopping carts, including adding/removing items and updating quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Order Service:</strong> Processes orders, including placing orders, tracking order status, and managing order history.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Service:</strong>  Handles payment processing, integrating with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).</li>
<li><strong>Notification Service:</strong> Sends email and SMS notifications for various events (e.g., order confirmation, shipping updates). You can use third-party services like Twilio or SendGrid for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-components"><strong>Additional Components:</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the core microservices, you can include the following components to enhance the scalability, reliability, and manageability of your e-commerce platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Gateway:</strong> Serves as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. It might be worth looking into Kong, Traefik, or NGINX for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Service Discovery:</strong> Automatically detects and manages service instances. You can use Consul or Eureka for service discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Aggregates logs from all microservices for easy monitoring and debugging. You can use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Docker &#x26; Docker Compose:</strong> Containerize each microservice and manages their orchestration, networking, and scaling. Docker Compose can be used to define and manage multi-container applications.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD Pipeline:</strong> Automates the build, test, and deployment process of each microservice. You can use Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps-to-get-started">Steps to Get Started:</h2>
<p>Here’s a high-level roadmap to guide you through the development of your scalable e-commerce platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up Docker and Docker Compose:</strong> Create Dockerfiles for each microservice. Use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Microservices:</strong> Start with a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for each service, then iterate by adding more features.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Services:</strong> Use REST APIs or gRPC for communication between microservices. Implement an API Gateway to handle external requests and route them to the appropriate services.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Service Discovery:</strong> Use Consul or Eureka to enable dynamic service discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Set up Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. Set up the ELK stack for centralized logging.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy the Platform:</strong> Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for production deployment. Implement auto-scaling and load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD Integration:</strong> Automate testing and deployment using Jenkins or GitLab CI.</li>
</ul>

A tooltip is a small pop-up box that provides additional information about a navigation item when a user hovers over it. This project will focus on mastering CSS positioning, hover effects, and creating visually appealing tooltips without relying on JavaScript.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to help you understand how to use CSS for dynamic UI effects. You will learn how to position elements relative to each other, create smooth transitions, and make your navigation more interactive and user-friendly. Below is a rough mockup showing the tooltip appearing above a navigation item.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Build a simple web page that will have different sections for different units of measurement. The user can input a value to convert, select the units to convert from and to, and view the converted value.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user can input a value to convert.</li>
<li>The user can select the units to convert from and to.</li>
<li>The user can view the converted value.</li>
<li>The user can convert between different units of measurement like length, weight, temperature, etc (more given below).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can include the following units of measurement to convert between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Length: millimeter, centimeter, meter, kilometer, inch, foot, yard, mile.</li>
<li>Weight: milligram, gram, kilogram, ounce, pound.</li>
<li>Temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>You don’t need to use any database for this project. There will be a simple webpage that will submit the form to the server and get the converted value back and display it on the webpage.</p>

<p>You can have 3 webpages for each type of unit conversion (length, weight, temperature) with forms to input the value and select the units to convert from and to. Submitting a form will submit the data to the current page (i.e. <code>target="_self"</code>) and display the converted value. You can do this using the backend programming language of your choice i.e. check if the form is submitted and then calculate the converted value and display it on the webpage, if not submitted then display the form.</p>`,po={title:"Unit Converter",description:"Unit converter to convert between different units of measurement.",isNew:!1,sort:500,difficulty:"beginner",nature:"Web App",skills:["Programming Language","HTML","Server","Logic Building"],seo:{title:"Unit Converter",description:"Build a Unit Converter to convert between different units of measurement.",keywords:["unit converter","backend project idea"]},roadmapIds:["backend","php","nodejs","python","java","golang","spring-boot"]},co="/workspace/src/data/projects/unit-converter.md",uo=void 0;a((t,o,n)=>{const{layout:s,...e}=po;return e.file=co,e.url=uo,i`${l()}${r(lo())}`});const ho=()=>`<p>You are required to create a simple RESTful API that allows users to shorten long URLs.

<p>Feel free to use any programming language, framework, and database of your choice for this project. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using JavaScript, you can use Node.js with Express.js</li>
<li>If you are using Python, you can use Flask or Django</li>
<li>If you are using Java, you can use Spring Boot</li>
<li>If you are using Ruby, you can use Ruby on Rails</li>
</ul>
<p>For databases, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>MySQL if you are using SQL</li>
<li>MongoDB if you are using NoSQL</li>
</ul>
<p>Your job is to implement the core functionality of the API, focusing on creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting short URLs, as well as tracking and retrieving access statistics. You don’t have to implement authentication or authorization for this project.</p>`,go={title:"URL Shortening Service",description:"Build a URL Shortener API that helps shorten long URLs.",isNew:!1,sort:1400,difficulty:"intermediate",nature:"API",skills:["Programming Language","Database Indexing","HTTP Redirects"],seo:{title:"URL Shortening Service Project Idea",description:"Build a URL Shortener API that helps shorten long URLs.",keywords:["url shortening service","backend project idea"]},roadmapIds:["backend","php","nodejs","python","java","golang","spring-boot"]},mo="/workspace/src/data/projects/url-shortening-service.md",yo=void 0;a((t,o,n)=>{const{layout:s,...e}=go;return e.file=mo,e.url=yo,i`${l()}${r(ho())}`});const fo=()=>`<p>In this project, instead of relying on our own weather data, we will build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from a 3rd party API. This project will help you understand how to work with 3rd party APIs, caching, and environment variables.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/weather-api-f8i1q.png" alt="Weather API"></p>
<p>As for the actual weather API to use, you can use your favorite one, as a suggestion, here is a link to <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Visual Crossing’s API</a>, it’s completely FREE and easy to use.</p>
<p>Regarding the in-memory cache, a pretty common recommendation is to use <a href="https://redis.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Redis</a>, you can read more about it <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/client-side-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, and as a recommendation, you could use the city code entered by the user as the key, and save there the result from calling the API.</p>
<p>At the same time, when you “set” the value in the cache, you can also give it an expiration time in seconds (using the <code>EX</code> flag on the <code>SET</code> command). That way the cache (the keys) will automatically clean itself when the data is old enough (for example, giving it a 12-hours expiration time).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="some-tips">Some Tips</h2>
<p>Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by creating a simple API that returns a hardcoded weather response. This will help you understand how to structure your API and how to handle requests.</li>
<li>Use environment variables to store the API key and the Redis connection string. This way, you can easily change them without having to modify your code.</li>
<li>Make sure to handle errors properly. If the 3rd party API is down, or if the city code is invalid, make sure to return the appropriate error message.</li>
<li>Use some package or module to make HTTP requests e.g. if you are using Node.js, you can use the <code>axios</code> package, if you are using Python, you can use the <code>requests</code> module.</li>
<li>Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API. You can use a package like <code>express-rate-limit</code> if you are using Node.js or <code>flask-limiter</code> if you are using Python.</li>
