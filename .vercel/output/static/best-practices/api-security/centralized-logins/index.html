<blockquote>
<p>Use centralized logins for all services and components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using centralized logins for all services and components is important for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Centralized logins enable you to manage authentication and authorization in one place, reducing the risk of security gaps or inconsistencies across different services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralized logins provide a single point of entry, allowing you to control access and monitor activity more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralized logins make it easier to enforce security policies across different services and components, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data or perform certain actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To use centralized logins, you need to set up a single sign-on (SSO) system that enables users to authenticate once and then access multiple services without having to provide credentials again. This can be done using protocols like OAuth or SAML, which enable secure authentication and authorization across different applications and services. Once set up, you can use centralized logging tools like ELK stack, Splunk, or Graylog to collect logs from different services and components and analyze them in one place. This enables you to quickly identify and respond to security threats or anomalies.</p>
