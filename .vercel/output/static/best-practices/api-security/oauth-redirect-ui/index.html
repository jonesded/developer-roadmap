<p>Validate `redirect_uriâ€™ on server-side to prevent open redirect attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In OAuth, <code>redirect_uri</code> is a parameter that specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that the authorization server should redirect the user to after authentication is complete. The <code>redirect_uri</code> is often used in the OAuth flow to return an authorization code or access token to the client application.</p>
<p>It is important to validate the <code>redirect_uri</code> on the server-side to prevent attacks such as open redirection attacks. In an open redirection attack, an attacker can modify the <code>redirect_uri</code> parameter to redirect the user to a malicious website. By validating the <code>redirect_uri</code> on the server-side, you can ensure that the redirect URI is a valid and authorized URI for the client application.</p>
<p>Validating the <code>redirect_uri</code> on the server-side can also prevent other types of attacks such as phishing attacks or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. By verifying that the <code>redirect_uri</code> matches a predefined list of authorized URIs, you can ensure that the user is redirected to a trusted site after authentication is complete.</p>
