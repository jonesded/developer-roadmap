<blockquote>
<p>Private APIs should only be accessible from safe listed IPs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private APIs should only be accessible from safe-listed IPs to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access the API. By restricting access to specific IP addresses, you can prevent unauthorized access from external networks or malicious actors. This can help to protect sensitive data and prevent attacks such as DDoS or brute-force attacks. Additionally, restricting access to safe-listed IPs can help to ensure the reliability and performance of the API by preventing excessive traffic from unauthorized sources.</p>
