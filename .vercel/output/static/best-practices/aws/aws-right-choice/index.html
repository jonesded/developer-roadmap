<p>Make sure AWS is right for your workload.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should make sure that using AWS is correct for your particular workload. If you have a steady load and 24/7 servers, it’s possible there are cheaper providers you can use, or it might even be cheaper to use dedicated hardware of your own. One of the big benefits of AWS is the ability to scale up and down rapidly in response to load, but not everyone needs that feature. As when purchasing anything, you should shop around a bit first to make sure you’re getting the best deal for what you need</p>
