<blockquote>
<p>Set up granular billing alerts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should always have at least one billing alert set up, but that will only tell you on a monthly basis once you’ve exceeded your allowance. If you want to catch runaway billing early, you need a more fine grained approach. The way I do it is to set up an alert for my expected usage each week. So the first week’s alert for say $1,000, the second for $2,000, third for $3,000, etc. If the week-2 alarm goes off before the 14th/15th of the month, then I know something is probably going wrong. For even more fine-grained control, you can set this up for each individual service, that way you instantly know which service is causing the problem. This could be useful if your usage on one service is quite steady month-to-month, but another is more erratic. Have the individual weekly alerts for the steady one, but just an overall one for the more erratic one. If everything is steady, then this is probably overkill, as looking at CloudWatch will quickly tell you which service is the one causing the problem.</p>
