<blockquote>
<p>Servers are ephemeral, you don’t care about them. You only care about the service as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a single server dies, it should be of no big concern to you. This is where the real benefit of AWS comes in compared to using physical servers yourself. Normally if a physical server dies, there’s panic. With AWS, you don’t care, because auto-scaling will give you a fresh new instance soon anyway. Netflix have taken this several steps further with their <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">simian army</a>, where they have things like <a href="https://github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chaos Monkey</a>, which will kill random instances in production (they also have Chaos Gorilla to kill AZs and I’ve heard rumour of a Chaos Kong to kill regions…). The point is that servers will fail, but this shouldn’t matter in your application.</p>
