<p>The backend performance of web applications can be substantially augmented by incorporating compiled languages such as Go or Rust. The essence of this lies in the manner these languages handle the conversion of code into machine language. Unlike interpreted languages, which convert the code into machine language during runtime, compiled languages do this step beforehand. This increased efficiency in translation results in faster performance of the code, especially valuable for performance-critical segments of your backend. For instance, Google uses Go language in several of their production systems for the very reason of increased performance and scalability. Similarly, Rust has gained acclaim in building highly concurrent and fast systems. Thus, using such compiled languages can greatly boost the overall backend performance.</p>
