<p>Backend performance of web applications can be significantly improved by fine-tuning connection pool settings. One of the main causes of performance degradation is the unnecessary utilization of resources. If a web application can reuse existing connections (via connection reuse parameters), instead of creating new ones each time a user sends a request, it saves a lot of processing time and power thereby improving performance. Moreover, by limiting the maximum number of idle connections, and setting suitable idle timeouts, enormous amounts of resources can be conserved. This not only improves performance but also makes the application more scalable. For instance, consider an e-commerce website during a huge sale where thousands of users are constantly connecting and disconnecting. By leveraging optimized connection pool settings, the application can process user requests more efficiently and faster, thus enhancing the siteâ€™s overall backend performance.</p>
