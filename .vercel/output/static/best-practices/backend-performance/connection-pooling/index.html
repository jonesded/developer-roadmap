<p>Effective backend performance in web applications heavily relies on proficiently managing database connections, for which connection pooling plays a crucial role. When a web application needs to establish multiple connections or reconnect frequently, high overhead can become burdensome and slow down performance. Utilizing connection pools addresses this issue by enabling applications to reuse existing connections, rather than needing to establish a new one for each user or session that needs database access. For instance, in a high traffic eCommerce website, leveraging connection pooling can significantly reduce lag in loading product details or processing transactions, resulting in a smoother user experience and increased operational efficiency. By reducing connection overhead through connection pooling, backend performance is greatly enhanced, leading to an optimized and expedited data exchange process.</p>
