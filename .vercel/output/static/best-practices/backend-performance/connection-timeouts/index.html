<p>Efficient management of network issues directly contributes to enhanced backend performance in web applications. When an application attempts to establish a network connection, a reasonable connection timeout ensures the process doesnâ€™t hang indefinitely while waiting for a response. This allows for optimal system resource utilization, reducing unnecessary load on the server, thereby enhancing backend performance. For example, a server dealing with heavy traffic might cause delays. If the connection timeout is set too low, the application might terminate the process prematurely, reducing efficiency. Meanwhile, an effective retry mechanism is crucial to handle network failures. Without an efficient retry mechanism, network failures could trigger serious system errors or downtime. For example, if a network call fails due to temporary network issues, a well-implemented retry mechanism can attempt at re-establishing the connection, ensuring uninterrupted backend operations and enhanced application performance.</p>
