<p>Web applications with high read demand benefit from a denormalized database schema, as it significantly improves backend performance. Primarily, denormalization reduces the need for costly join operations, making data retrieval quicker and more efficient. For example, an e-commerce application with millions of views per day would benefit from denormalized schema because each product page view might need to fetch data from multiple tables such as product, reviews, price, and vendor details. If these tables are denormalized into a single table, it eradicates the need for join operations, making the page load faster for end users. The subsequent boost in efficiency benefits the backend system by alleviating processing strain and enables it to deal with higher volume loads, thus enhancing overall backend performance.</p>
