<p>Handling large datasets effectively is key to improving backend performance in web applications. When a database query returns too much data, it can lead to slow load times and a poor user experience. Implementing efficient pagination significantly reduces the amount of data to be processed at once, thus reducing server load and latency times. For example, instead of loading thousands, or even millions, of records in one go, pagination allows it to load only a specific number of records per page, boosting speed and efficiency. It helps ensure seamless data retrieval, an impressive server response time, and ultimately better overall performance.</p>
