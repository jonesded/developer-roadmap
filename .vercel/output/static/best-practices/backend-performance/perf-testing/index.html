<p>Maintaining optimal backend performance in web applications involves consistent and regular performance testing and benchmarking. This practice helps in pinpointing any performance regressions which could otherwise significantly slow down the applications, leading to a subpar user experience. For example, if a new feature introduces memory leaks, regular testing can catch it before the feature is deployed. It also highlights improvements and illustrates the actual impact of optimization efforts over time. Through regular testing, ineffective optimizations can be scrapped before too many resources are invested into them, while beneficial strategies can be identified and further fine-tuned. Consequently, these actions contribute to a more efficient and productive application performance management strategy.</p>
