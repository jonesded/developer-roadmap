<p>The backend performance of web applications can greatly benefit from the utilization of profiling tools provided by the database. These tools allow for the identification and isolation of performance bottlenecks within an application. By identifying slow queries or areas of inefficient data retrieval, detection of these issues early-on can prevent the propagation of defects through the application, ultimately enhancing user experience. For instance, MySQL features a database profiling tool that can identify query performance through examination of query execution times. Profiling not only contributes to maintaining the speed and efficiency of a website, but also enables developers to optimize their code more effectively, saving valuable development time and resources.</p>
