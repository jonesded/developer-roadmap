<p>Safeguarding backend performance necessitates database replication, as it increases redundancy thus enhancing data consistency across different systems. It facilitates simultaneous access to the same data from various servers, which significantly optimizes read performance. This is particularly beneficial for web applications that experience substantial read loads. For example, consider a busy e-commerce site during a sales event. If all read and write operations occur on the same database, it could lead to performance lags. However, with database replication, such high-volume read operations can be redirected to replicated servers, assuring smooth and efficient customer experiences.</p>
