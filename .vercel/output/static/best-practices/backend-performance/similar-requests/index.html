<p>The capacity of a web applicationâ€™s backend to process large volumes of data promptly and efficiently plays a crucial role in its performance. Grouping similar requests together in a batch, rather than processing them individually, considerably reduces data transfer overhead. This is because it minimizes the number of round trips, or interactions between the client and server to obtain a response. For instance, in an e-commerce application, instead of retrieving each product detail individually, batching gathers all product details in a single request, which enhances response times and overall performance.</p>
