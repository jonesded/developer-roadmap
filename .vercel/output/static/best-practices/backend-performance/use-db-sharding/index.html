<p>When it comes to backend performance, the effectiveness of data management is critical. Here lies the value of database sharding, a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. Sharding can enhance the speed of data retrieval by spreading the load across multiple servers, thereby reducing bottlenecks and improving overall application responsiveness. For instance, in an e-commerce application with a worldwide customer base, data can be sharded on a geographical basis to ensure faster loading times for consumers, no matter where they are located. This improves user experience and ensures smooth operation on the backend side.</p>
