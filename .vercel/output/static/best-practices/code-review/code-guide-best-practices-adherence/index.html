<p>Ensuring that code changes adhere to the project’s coding standards and best practices is a critical aspect of a successful code review. This involves evaluating the quality and consistency of the code, as well as making sure that the changes are efficient, secure, and maintainable. In this section, we will provide you with some tips on how to assess adherence to coding standards and best practices during the code review process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the project’s coding guidelines and best practices: Before diving into the review, read and understand the project’s established coding standards, such as naming conventions, indentation, and commenting styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize linters and code analyzers: These tools can automatically identify inconsistencies in the code and detect potential issues related to best practices, thereby reducing manual effort to detect such issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for code smells: Code smells are indicators of potential issues in the code’s maintainability or performance. Keep an eye out for code duplication, large functions or classes, and unclear variable or function names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate design patterns and principles: Ensure that the implementation follows established design patterns and principles like SOLID, DRY, and KISS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider security: Evaluate the code for possible security risks, such as input validation, proper error handling, and unsafe API usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess test coverage: Ensure that the submitted code includes adequate test coverage to validate the correctness of the changes and avoid regressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide constructive feedback: When pointing out adherence issues or suggesting improvements, make sure to provide specific examples and clear explanations. Encourage the contributor to discuss and clarify any concerns.</p>
