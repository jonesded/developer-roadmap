<p>Tackling large and complex tasks in software development can be overwhelming and time-consuming, not to mention the challenges it brings during the code review process. By breaking down these tasks into smaller, more manageable PRs (Pull Requests), we can ensure a smoother, faster, and more accurate code review. Smaller PRs are easier to understand, test, and merge which speeds up the development cycle and results in better code quality. Here are some tips to making sure your tasks are broken down into smaller PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modularize your code - Make sure your code is divided into logical modules and functions, with each module serving a single responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on one feature or bug fix per PR - Resist the temptation to fix multiple issues or implement several features within the same PR. This keeps the scope of the PR narrow and easier to review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the changes incremental - If a task requires a significant amount of code changes, break it down into multiple PRs that can be built and tested independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate with your team - Make sure your team members know which tasks have been broken down and the order in which they should be reviewed and merged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draft clear and concise PR descriptions - Outline the scope, purpose, and technical details of the PR, making it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and provide relevant feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
