<p>In the code review process, one essential step is merging the approved code change into the main or feature branch. This involves integrating the changes made on a separate branch or fork, which were reviewed and approved by your peers, into a single unified branch. This step not only helps maintain the stability of the codebase but also ensures a seamless collaboration amongst team members. To guarantee the success of this phase, follow the tips below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always perform a test run: Before you merge, ensure that the tests pass locally and in the CI system to prevent broken builds or unexpected failures.</li>
<li>Keep the main branch stable: Update your branch with the latest changes from the main branch before merging, to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies.</li>
<li>Utilize Pull Requests/Merge Requests: Use collaborative features like Pull Requests in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket to track peer reviews, comments and approvals.</li>
<li>Embrace rebasing: With rebasing, you can keep your Git history cleaner and linear, avoiding unnecessary merge commits.</li>
<li>Opt for a code review tool: Make use of code review tools like Gerrit or Phabricator to manage and track the review process in a structured way.</li>
<li>Merge fast, merge often: Encourage smaller changes and frequent merges to avoid stagnation and complex conflict resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, youâ€™ll be able to streamline your codebase, enhance collaboration, and uphold the overall quality of your software project.</p>
