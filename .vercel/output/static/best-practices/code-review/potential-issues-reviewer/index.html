<p>Code reviews are a crucial part of ensuring the quality, maintainability, and efficiency of software. One particularly important aspect of a code review is identifying potential performance, security, and scalability concerns. This involves examining the submitted code for any areas where it may not perform well, exhibit vulnerabilities, or have difficulty handling increased usage. As a code reviewer, it is your responsibility to discuss these concerns with the author and offer suggestions for improvement. This ensures the final product is not only functionally correct but also delivers a robust and stable experience for its users. In this section, we will provide some tips on how to effectively evaluate code for performance, security, and scalability during a review, and how to address any issues that arise.</p>
