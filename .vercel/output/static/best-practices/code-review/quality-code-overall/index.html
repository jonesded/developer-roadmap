<p>As a code reviewer, your role is not limited to just identifying bugs and potential errors. You must also assess whether the code is easy to understand, modify, and adapt to various scenarios. To ensure that you cover all aspects of this crucial evaluation, here are some tips to help you examine code quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Readability: Check if the code uses meaningful variable and function names, proper indentation, and clear comments. Make sure it follows the established coding conventions of its programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainability: Look for code duplication, overly complex logic, or tightly-coupled modules that make the code difficult to modify or extend. Encourage the use of modular, reusable components and adherence to the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability: Evaluate if the code can handle increasing workloads, users, or data sizes without significant performance degradation. Identify bottlenecks or resource-heavy operations, and suggest optimizations or alternative solutions when appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By emphasizing these three aspects during code review, you will promote a culture of high-quality code that is easy to collaborate on and adapt for future requirements.</p>
