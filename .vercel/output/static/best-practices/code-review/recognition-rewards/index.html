<p>Recognizing and rewarding individuals who consistently provide quality feedback during code reviews is a vital aspect of nurturing a healthy and efficient software development environment. When team members feel appreciated for their valuable input, they are more likely to take code reviews seriously and continue contributing to improve the codebase. In this section, we will discuss various techniques and approaches to ensure that those who consistently offer high-quality feedback are duly acknowledged and rewarded for their efforts. This recognition not only fosters a culture of collaboration but also motivates others to raise the bar on the caliber of their input during code reviews.</p>
