<p>To achieve this, I recommend adopting a team-wide style guide, which serves as the authoritative reference for code styling within the project. As a reviewer, your role is to verify the changes against this guide, rather than imposing your personal preferences. This helps to reduce inconsistencies and foster a collaborative environment. To ensure the effective implementation of the style guide, consider the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a clear and concise style guide that covers all major aspects of code styling, such as naming conventions, indentation, and code organization.</li>
<li>Share the style guide with all team members and make sure everyone understands its requirements and follows them consistently.</li>
<li>Integrate automated linting tools and formatters into your development process to check and enforce code style automatically.</li>
<li>Provide dedicated workshops or training sessions to new team members on the style guide, so that they can quickly get up to speed with the team’s preferred style.</li>
<li>During the code review process, focus on ensuring that the changes align with the style guide. If you find deviations, point them out and guide the developer towards the proper style.</li>
<li>Continuously review and update the style guide based on the team’s changing needs and preferences. Encourage team members to suggest improvements and changes to make the guide more effective over time.</li>
</ul>
