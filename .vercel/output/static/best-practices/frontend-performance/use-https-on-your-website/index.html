<p>HTTPS is not only for ecommerce websites, but for all websites that are exchanging data. Data shared by a user or data shared to an external entity. Modern browsers today limit functionalities for sites that are not secure. For example: geolocation, push notifications and service workers don’t work if your instance is not using HTTPS. And today is much more easy to setup a project with an SSL certificate than it was before (and for free, thanks to Let’s Encrypt).</p>
